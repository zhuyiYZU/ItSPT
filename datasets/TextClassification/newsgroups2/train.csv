But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my system but on 5.25 disks.  I hate using 5.25 disks so I copied them over to high density 3.5's using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In fact for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you copy them over with one disk per directory but if you want to you can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer when you're switching printer emulations around. Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with but when a friend's system crashed we restored from a backup rather than from the originals and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton c:\nu would create a workable backup and if you did a full install the first time you've got the whole thing. Never played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything from Utah. Good luck.... Disclaimer: Don't Copy That Floppy! (tm) Just Say No! (r) Respect Your Elders!

Thanks. A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible however to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip also available on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the normal keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).

"1","I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB. When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600 everything is fine but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows AutoCAD GIFs) the screen gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4 bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can manually change the V-Size on the back this is a pain in the ass and it just shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story... So if anyone has had this same problem please let me know if you know what to do.  Hell let me know if you don't have a solution just so I know I'm not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance. Jude M. Greer jmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set- ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size of the 800x600 screen it just starts to cut off the top and bottom."

"1","Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in. Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it. It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications. I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then maps the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can cd to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor! So I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-) John -- John Gayman WA3WBU UUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john Packet: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH"

At least : locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong and : he has to fix it. Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms but not so quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included).  But my experience with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn about the products they sell.  Talk about incompetent!  O.K. so a few percent of their answers are correct but those salesmen don't even realize how stupid they are.   ...  .......  O.K.  ...I'll settle down now....  .... let me catch my breath.....  .. Fact: retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product. Retail outlets are desirable however to those people who aren't interested in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions.  This is fine; for example most of my education about carpeting wall paper lawn mowers microwave ovens etc. has come from sales personnel.  I assume I must be an idiot.  But I don't care about those things.  I do however care about my computer - i.e. I demand features and performance and I'll be damned if I'll pay some high-school drop out commission on an over-rated over-priced system and in the process be subjected to his distorted B.S.

Kinda fun.  8) First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom. Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center and left.    The bios should read either :     62-000042-015 or 62-000094-0x2 If the last 3 digits are 013 you got problems. > >Controller jumpers are set as follows: (- represents jumper) >	W1	1-2 3 >       W2      1-2 3 >	W3	1-2 >	W4	1 2-3 >	W5	1 2 3 >	W6	1-2 3 >	W7	1 2 3 Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address. >The drive jumpers are as follows: (8 represents jumper) Looks right. [art deleted] >Here are my questions: > >1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other? I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom set it like this: 5 + +    open 6 + +    open 7 + +    open 8 + +    open 4 + +    closed 3 + +    closed 2 + +    open 1 + +    open Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 34 and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 12 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1). If you have the 62-000094 rom it's a auto-config and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here. >2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly? See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also  at the risk of being insulting make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251 try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other. The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day..... >3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade? Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter: -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt) This will return the rom date if it's of any use. >Keith Rice If I oversimplified any of the above I appologize.

NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive. When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will not boot.  To solve this problem one of the ROM BIOS chips must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital XT controller card you must remove the jumper at position W-3 or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT controller you are using). -2- NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1 WD1004A-WX1 WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in Tandy 1000 series computers models SX TX and the original or A version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) instead of IRQ5 the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems you must cut the etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the modification a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1 WDXT-GEN2 or the WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system a zero ohm resister must be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

"1","Hi All I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards eg. one can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters et.c. Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some non-trivial data to the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off typeamatic specs.) from inside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in the specs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas? (Except that they may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above which wouldn't look too neat besides what would one do from an XT?) Great thanks in advance Andrew."

"1","Hi. I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX-50. My computer configuration is : 486DX-50 Mhz. 8/256 kB EISA (Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz) 16MB Ram ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk SCSI UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller When I use Norton6.0 Harddisk benchmark I get a Harddisk data transfer about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1MB/sec. Is that good ? I thought that with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec. Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read that some host adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk performance in that system do I need that ? A guy I know gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec and he has an ST3283A and a ISA 486DX-50 how can a ISA with the same system be faster ? Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?

AY> AY> Many thanx in advance! AY> AY>Andrew. Andrew yes there is a DX and DX2 version of the 50MHz 486.  If you are considering buying one or the other definitely go for the DX with a nice size external cache!  The performance is far greater. The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz while the DX has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither systems could actually run a program out of main memory since DRAM is still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ). -rdd --- . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean cache speed is one thing but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O so just get that faster... I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)! regards JV ///// name:    J-V Meuldijk                                          [ o o ] address: gildelaar 4                                            \_=_/ 4847 hw teteringen                                     _| |_ holland                  e-mail:  volkert@kub.nl      / \_/ \ _____________________________________________________________oOOO___OOOo__"

Try another vendor I wish I had. While others here may have had better experiences I too share the sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM it is only relatively recent that the Windows drivers for this card have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing mis-drawn check boxes etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01. If there's a more recent release I'd appreciate if someone would drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their BBS lately to check again.  Naturally Diamond doesn't even bother notifying me of fixes/releases. Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the right person in curing some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting addresses (2E0 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.

In fact I can hear the noise in If your Gateway is equipped with a Western hard drive then the noise is probably coming from there and not from the fan.  The Western drives are notoriously noisy.  On the other hand if you don't have a Western drive then maybe it is the fan.  There's not alot to do about it except insulate around the cpu somehow.

Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different TSR programs. 2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card. 3.

"1","Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS using C++ to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085. I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character if a 0x20 is received the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently I am at a loss as to what may be wrong.  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment?

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17 monitors (also a newly available) and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board. Do not buy a 486SX sytem. My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models. Gordon"

"1","Howdy Sorry if this has been covered before: One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course I said No problem and went to work. Unfortunately the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried to remove the primary partition which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC)... Thanks in advance Paul Mr. SCSI... NOT! Fincke"
"1","I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am running Linux as my main OS with a small DOS partition left for my flatmates' games. My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS and (120+100)Mbyte IDE. Basically I have two choices 1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or 2) Get some sort of 486. Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high. The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25. I have a couple of questions. 1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a 386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS and alot of Floating Point operations. 2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ? Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ? Any experiences will be most helpful ... Kenny. PS.

Does he have to use new parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? When it comes to local dealers: - Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their techs are re-treaded salesmen not trained technicians with a high turnover rate. - Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously. - Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply or even done period unless you are on a paid service contract. Having been both a service technician and a service manager at a ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place I know what I'm talking about. I also know the local service scam that retail computer dealers like to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers having been singing for years -- Buy from me and you'll get good service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition and you'll be sorry if you need service. Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order companies that give excellent service including overnight replacement parts on-site calls etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you good service too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good service you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can. - Ted Drude (tbdrude@infonode.ingr.com)"

"1","H E L P ! I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day... Some background about my PC: - American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM - config.sys file: device=c:\dos\himem.sys dos=highumb device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems files=30 buffers=30 stack=9256 - autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c - CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram. The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31 I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL. Run excel no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place for windows. Ok I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them: - Stack fault by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure by ndw.exe at same address Some how the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means? I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat no help. Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running. Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try anything. -------------- Steve Chu AT&T Bell Labs Holmdel NJ"

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use slower RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash. Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM. Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

Then not having anything better to try I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_ driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards. I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila! the PC booted from power up although it seemed to take several seconds before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns. O.K. with this additional information does anyone in netland have any words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it? -Larry still (un)plugging away Byler-"

"1","Hello I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have 8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie. both banks are full and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows and I know that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS the only solution I can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180 and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather avoid... So my question is do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work how do they do it?  Is a device driver needed or will the BIOS pickup the extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits so probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly appreciated. -Eric ebosco@us.oracle.com"

"1","I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work and I have the option of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well and is working fine but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup. The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0 The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head 300 write_pre 977 landing zone). There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave.  Originally the drive in the machine had none.  Currently I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave. When booted the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does flicker about three times on the second drive but then gives the error. Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive I would not even know how to do that. Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not a number for Western Digital might just do as good! swood -- Hunting over in Michigan?

Fortunately I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer. I would really like to try Gateway again I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...

"1","Hello I have recently suffered from various problems concerning an Adaptec 1542A controller. Problem 1: Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like to know if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they are located. Problem 2: My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime Miniscribe) I get a message 'Missing operating system' even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting the MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible memory drivers. Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?

"1","I have a 286 with an M205 motherboard.  The Last Byte memory manager (which I downloaded for a trial) reports the chipset is an AddTech PCCHIP1 chipset and it is able to activate the ram behind segments A000-FFFF which can then be used for UMBs (except for video/BIOS).  I would like to write my own driver to activate the memory.  Does anyone know where I can get programming information on this chip? Phil"
"1","Hi I'm looking to buy a 17 monitor soon and it seems that I can't decide what monitor I should buy. I have a MAG 17S (this is a .25 dpi version and it using a TRINITON tube) and a NANAO 560i in mind. Does anyone know of any specification or problems these monitor have? Actually any related opinions at buying a 17 monitor will be welcomed. Thanks in advance ong_mang@iastate.edu"
"1","* Attention voters: * * I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting. * Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV. * If your name/address is not there please send your vote again. * (Actually check even if you voted after the first day) Introduction: This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one: (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated) (b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated) (c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated) (d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated) (e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated) This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting and comp.os.os2.setup and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31 1992).  The voting rules state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started after a six month waiting period (in this case it is March 1 1993). This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and comp.os.os2.bugs. This document contains: *  the background showing the need for these proposals *  the proposed charters for these proposals *  voting instructions *  a voting ballot *  some example ballots *  the voting rules *  the voting schedule *  the Mass Acknowledgement Background: The creation of two free 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2 and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms such as emacs less awk grep sed xscheme ispell flex yacc and much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software. Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS and later Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x the number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility with their hardware increases as does the questions on the availability of drivers for their hardware installation procedures etc. Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore IBM is including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version 2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1). Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2. So far IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites or for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read comp.os.os2.misc for details). Proposed Charters: (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so as to coordinate efforts avoid duplication of effort and spur additional development.  The group will also cover topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS Windows UNIX etc) toolkits which aid in program portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors) and so forth. (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated) To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy orthogonal comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting. (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated) It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics including the availability of device drivers compatibility information installation procedures system requirements and overall performance optimization. (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues. (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated) It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports bug diagnosis and work arounds the availability of system patches and corrective service disks and so forth. [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other newsgroups and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in comp.os.os2.beta] How to Vote: To cast your vote fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me. Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this post.  Be sure to send only the ballot and edit out the rest of this post. 1)  Type in your vote for each proposal: If you favor the charter as proposed put a yes after its name. If you oppose the charter as proposed put a no after its name. To abstain leave a blank after its name. 2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name) a comma and your first name (i.e. your personal name). 3)  Cut out the ballot  Please do not delete any lines of the ballot. 4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm (Central Time) April 24 1993. Ballot: ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here---- (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: (f)       voter's last first name: e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24 ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here---------------- Example Ballot #1: (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no (f)       voter's last first name: Smith John In this example John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting to be created and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. Example Ballot #2: (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes (f)       voter's last first name: Doe Jane In this example Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all the proposals. Voting Rules: * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once only the most recent vote will be counted. * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting forwarding posting votes to a newsgroup etc. will not be counted. * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings will be revealed only after the poll closes. * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will post the ACK twice (see Schedule below). * If you need help for using your editor using e-mail how voting works in general etc. then ask an expert at your site. Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is posted to news.answers on a regular basis. * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this CFV send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu. * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below) a proposal passes if both of the following formulas are true: 1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100 or YES - NO >= 100). 2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO or YES - NO >= NO). In other words a proposal passes if: YES - NO >= max (100 NO) where max() returns the highest number given to it. Schedule: The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator). This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV but it also has the Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you have not voted yet vote now! The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time) on April 24 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count. The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that date. Mass Acknowledgement: Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15 1993: bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari Sanjay

"1","I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do 1024x768 non-interlaced which seems like a good deal. However it is a fixed-scan rate monitor and only handles 52 kHz horizontal I think. With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62 - not much use since just about any application will set the mode to something else especially if it wants to do text I suppose. Anyway: - is there any way that I can use this as a general-purpose VGA display with a 1-meg trident 8900C card? - if not can I do so with some sort of different VGA card? Peter Desnoyers --"
"1","While rummaging through a box of old PC (5150) parts I found a half-size board that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems and has a copyright date of 1986 on it.  The board provides a male 24-pin connector and has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PC and ran Advanced diagnostics several times changing the jumper positions each time but the system did not recognise a comm port. Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it? I could use another comm port if it's free. Bryan"

"1","Hi I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video and thanks to Orchid I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say Buy the memory from us or something like that.) The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why and all I got was Your point is well taken but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects. So to get to the point finally ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken. If you want these modes steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB) at least until their developers are less busy.  If the magazines are to believed I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?) although evenn that might be a misprint. Please if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL. Thanks. donyee@athena.mit.edu"
"1","> My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ 5 which is > unreserved in contemporary computers (using IRQ 5 for the > drives went out with the XT architechture ... ) Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines IRQ5 is reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt. On the other hand we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1 a Mouse on COM2 and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5 and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3 our problems went away.  Grumble ... after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work. ~ Mike  (sprague.wbst311@xerox.com)"

"1","I have a 486DX33 ISA system with 4 meg.  I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor video card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am running Windows and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping the program manager window) and I close the active application window erasure is very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application. The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card but it does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip or is there something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of? Thanks.

"1","This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set the other is Micron (formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard. I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr 7 days/wk) and a better warrantee (2 years).  Micron on the other hand seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the company. I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc. Thanks very much in advance for any information. -- Mohammad Al-Ansari"

Something like 90% of my CPU time is being spent reading the joystick and this is in a program that does nothing but printf() and JoyRead().

"1","Hi I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive.

However just in case something went wrong I'm going to describe some of the changes needed to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also you may have noticed that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower even when you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called Windows 3.1 runs slowly. * MSDOS configuration: The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive (this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs much much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section called Windows 3.1 runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system up. * Windows configuration: To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows make sure that the [388Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry: VirtualHDIRQ=Off I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry to SYSTEM.INI but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you you might want to try adding some more lines: VirtualHDIRQ=Off SystemROMBreakPoint=false EMMExclude=A000-CFFF (You probably don't need the above lines though.)  The SystemROMBreakPoint entry is used to enable support for memory managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs). * Windows 3.1 runs slowly: Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542 chances are that your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not it's probably because: 1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a winning solution. 2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen .... If your system is running much slower than before this is almost definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the Windows documentation and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808 (SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS) you must use Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works it really slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable I looked for other solutions. Unfortunately you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you do Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1. What you can do is one of the following: 1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double-buffering or by a bug in Smartdrive. 2. Use a driver that provides VDS services (VDS stands for Virtual DMA Services).  This is a standard which is supported by Windows 3.1 that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like the 1542) to work with Windows. After trashing my hard disk countless times I found the following solutions none of which require using Smartdrive (note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably *NOT* caused by these solutions but might be -- see below).  While the following does not require Smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended as this makes Windows run much much faster: 1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver or you do not need ASPI functions (for controlling a CDROM tape drive more than two physical hard disks etc.) you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your CONFIG.SYS file e.g.: DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386 (Windows needs the /V386 option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory) and it occupies about 16-20K.  As of November 1992 the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully it's still there). 2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver version 3.0 or 3.0a you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers in your CONFIG.SYS file e.g.: DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386 Amazingly enough the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would crash my system but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support about this and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW. On my system NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting Windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE the default Windows shell and vice-versa.  This is the reason SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary. I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0. Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider these people lucky.  Others like me have had all sorts of problems. 3. In my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer needed.  Unfortunately while you could get previous ASPI4DOS upgrades from the Adaptec BBS the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know there are only three ways to get a copy: * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver kit which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other drivers such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is around $75. * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS you can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for around $30. * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1. Note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors with Windows.  In all probability defective hardware in my PC is causing this as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above solutions.  However because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the parity errors are driver-related (for example changing the bus on/off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers (this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems show up only under disk I/O).  However I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem. ***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices: There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device such as the Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250: 1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops etc. 2. Tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape errors. (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542. However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my 1542.) * Tape backups/restores take a long time: If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device you may have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 bus on/off timing for best results when using the tape drive.  Normally while doing a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with only an occasional pause.  However the default bus timing on the Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive (however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean). This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than necessary. The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive and the Adaptec uses DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA the tape drive stops rewinds a bit and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it). The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is too large.  For example when a backup is done data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec hogs the memory too much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory) not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive.  As a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops because data is not fed to it quickly enough. The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The default factory setting is 11 microseconds on and 5 microseconds off. The bus on timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can be done in one of two ways: * If you have ASPI4DOS you can use the /n option.  For example I use a bus on timing of 4 microseconds which means that I use the following line in my CONFIG.SYS file: DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4 Note that there is NO space between the /n and the 4. * If you don't have ASPI4DOS your only recourse is to try to find a program called SETSCSI.EXE which is very difficult to find.  The reason is that Adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for Adaptec and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet you could try using archie to hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have it.  If you do find a copy you run it like so: setscsi -n:4 This adjusts the bus on timing to 4 microseconds.  Running SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults. Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS however. Do not lower the bus on timing below 2 microseconds or increase it above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me 4 microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards a little. Once you've lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores should run faster. Also do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other options that I have intentionally not described) unless you know what you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by starving memory refresh. A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while) this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However when I tried running this program with my 1542A my system crashed.  At the time I was running SCSIHA.SYS and I didn't check to see if there was a conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B although the docs say that it works with the 1542A? * Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors: This problem may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my system a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it. However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my 1542. Symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the tape head: 1. Backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting in an aborted tape backup. 2. Tape backup works but the tape compare fails. 3. The tape drive starts stops starts stops etc. much too often. Unlike the above-mentioned problem (Tape backups/restores take a long time) where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so. 4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other programs like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the tape drive but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot. 5. Too many tape read errors. Although I do not know what is causing this problem I discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago I upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542 I initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while I decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard.  When I did this the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250) reliability increased dramatically and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive. I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542. On the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542 which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the 1542.  On the other hand the tape drive didn't work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542.  I did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is; however if you're having similar problems you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller. ***** Sound cards: Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA the Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the tape DMA this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error (your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the Adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a parity error.  Usually getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system; in this case however the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware. I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity (e.g. higher sampling rate recording in stereo recording using 16-bits instead of 8 etc.). Like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the Adaptec's bus on timing.  See the section on tape drives for information on how this is done.  Note however that this may or may not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem (i.e. some software is inefficient).  Disk caches the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this. ***** Miscellaneous info: This section contains miscellaneous hints tips and rumors.  Much of it is merely information that I've heard or read about and have not verified.  I believe that the following information is correct but I'm not sure.  Use it at your own risk. * With QEMM 6.00 6.01 and 6.02 you need to specify the DB= parameter (e.g. DB=2) unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver. If you don't QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM command line (at least this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of QEMM probably need this parameter but I'm not sure (I've never used a version earlier than 6.00). If you use ASPI4DOS you do not need to give QEMM the DB= parameter. * Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB you need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec. * To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542 you need a SCSI CDROM drive and some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package which lists for something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains everything that you need. 2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package which is made by the same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM drivers SCSI tape drivers WORM drivers etc.  I do not know the list price but I've seen this package sold for around $80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS driver which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead. 3. [This method is obsolete as the following drivers have been obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit but I'm mentioning it in case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410 kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver) if it is not included in the ASW-410 kit but this is available from several bulletin boards. * To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542 you need software that knows how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are (again like the above section on CDROM drives I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers (ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup. 2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more details).  However note that CorelSCSI! does not come with but requires ASPI4DOS. * I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations: 1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS. 2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers. 3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS Adaptec ASPI drivers and CorelSCSI! drivers/programs. I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration: 4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI drivers). * Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used this version of GNU tar but I've heard that it works (I don't know how well though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites: PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL> ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives Adaptec 154xx ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10 ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape Adaptec ctrlr I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might have it if any forum does. * As far as MSDOS is concerned the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are the same; with MSDOS the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B. However the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical and there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work with a 1542A but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of BSD Unix). * In case anyone's curious here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file: FILES=40 BUFFERS=40 BREAK=ON STACKS=10256 DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF DOS=HIGHUMB DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE shell = c:\dos\command.com /p Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like: FILES=40 BUFFERS=40 BREAK=ON STACKS=10256 DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF DOS=HIGHUMB DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386 DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE shell = c:\dos\command.com /p If I weren't using ASPI4DOS I'd probably use something that looked like: FILES=40 BUFFERS=40 BREAK=ON STACKS=10256 DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386 DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF DOS=HIGHUMB DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE shell = c:\dos\command.com /p However if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive or if I planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card I would still need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this but this last version doesn't. Local Variables: fill-column:	72 eval:		(auto-fill-mode nil) End:"

"1","Hello world I'm attempting to write an 8051 simulator on an IBM PC for teaching purposes so that first-year elec-eng students can 'see' the workings of the microcontroller as it performs operations - logical ands for example being shown on a bit-by-bit basis (1 AND 1 = 1) so that the students can see that it's not really a mystical process but totally logical for example. Every instruction should show some 'working' and not just alter register/memory/port contents. Does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code in Pascal or Modula-2 that would show me where I'm going wrong in writing my simulator? [I'm using Ayala's -The 8051 Microcontroller- as a reference - the simulator supplied with the package is overkill for simple teaching purposes I feel and there's no source code to help you roll your own.] Please email me if you can help or if you know of somewhere more appropriate I should be posting this  - I rarely scan these groups.

XT drives usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The two are not compatible on the same controller. However you might be able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I think).

"1","I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system: 486-33 DX 16 mb of ram on a Novell 3.11 network Monitor:  NEC 4FGe capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate Major considerations: I expect I will work mostly in windows but with some DOS applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word processing database and communications--not much intensive graphics. With a 15 monitor I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256 colors seems plenty but I'd like like the image to be sharp fast and rock solid. Other considerations: I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party development of drivers. I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking. I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and upgrading to local bus later). I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well. If you have any advice for me I'd love to hear it via email or post. Thanks. |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ David M.

"1","I started a similar thread about a month ago and got many replies. The summary: CTX 14: Nasty low quality. Avoid. CTX 15 Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however cheap. Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning (the problem I had) others poor focus etc etc. I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. It's now clear well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. I'm very happy with it and the digital controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly a Trinitron (say) would be much nicer but that's well out of my price range. Conclusion: If you're on a budget get one and be prepared to send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it but has good potential. Chris"

Several others here also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate appears ok for me but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of spending money with the size of today's files etc a tape backup is certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost."

Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine and I wondered whether I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room for a 9 wire-bus but not for the 34 wire bus) How can I solve my problem any suggestions? If you need more info mail me please (luttik@fwi.uva.nl). --Bas."
"1","Hi! I'd like to switch my floppy drives so that my 3.5 b: drive becomes a: while my 5.25 a: becomes b:. I'm having a few problems though.

"1","Hi Netters! I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about my situation I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario: 1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive). The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / restore program.  Both systems have 3.5 and 5.25 floppies. 2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon). From what I have seen so far there appear to be at least 4 possible solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these options I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y etc.) in my thinking (I don't know very much about these beasts): 1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system. Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand? What do the floppies themselves cost? 2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again can someone recommend a few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)? 3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?) 4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again any gotcha's or recommendations for manufacturers? I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will summarize all responses for the net.

"1","About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver. So should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number? Any assistance appreciated.

"1","Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about 3 minutes to warm up. Previously when I first start up my PC I can see all the CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight). If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on again the display works as normal like before. Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a 386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet. I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer. Thanks a lot.

My own Intel 14.4k ( v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it at 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem at the other machine is a Turbomodem+ from The Complete PC (the machines are in seperate houses so a direct serial link is impossible and copying this much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines on for a few hours and go see a movie--no this is not pirated software). I am having no end of trouble trying to set it up.  It will dial and connect just fine--at 9600 baud.  But if I try to set the comm at 19k2 38.4k or 56kbps the stupid thing connects but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k). His machine (a dx48633) has a 16550AFN UART so that's not the problem. It seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to a comm program _at_ 14.400bps even though it will take dialing instructions at 56k (and respond OK etc. to other commands).  I don't have a comm program that can do precisely 14.4k. I looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is I didn't have this trouble with the Intel--it came ready to connect this way.  Do I need to initialize it any way in particular? Also it's _using_ V.42bis and V.42 (and MNP5) when connecting here (i.e. at 9600 since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far) but it doesn't _say_ so there.  any ideas?

Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.

(at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms. Is there any argument that IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because of a higher RPM platter different arrangement of heads etc?)? >: Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive >: controller)  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do >: at least 5 maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence? >: What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost? > >No that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS SCSI can use both drives >at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly. If data is going from one drive to another and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory then yes that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus? >I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I >haven't seen IDE drives cheaper. A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245 million bytes or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers? >No actually we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because >nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: >easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or >Mac) then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice. So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)

"1","Hello all You the Net are my last resort or I'll just change my job :-) This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any. Sys: 486/33 AMI BIOS and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with serials/paral/floppies and - IDE controller clone Gw2760-EX there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( - Quantum ProDrive LPS (3 105M type 47: 755cyl 16hds 17spt). Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand neat price): - Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M <15ms BIOS type 1 ctrller manages the real geom: 1630cyl 8hds 52spt) - Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies. (jumpers set IRQ 14/15 hw port addr 1F0/170 and BIOS addr CC00/C800 and other floppy/format stuff) Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be a nice bonus but is not expected. Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI or even from HD is acceptable. I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE depending on setup/jumpers. Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - ---  --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron and can change a chip or put a jumper! Also useful: - BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital. - ftp archives with relevant info. - expert stores in Toronto Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while) - any hints into inner workings of the system ... - anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) ) Direct or posted replies are ok.

"1","I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286 and could use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is familiar with them. The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB tower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB 8MB 200MB IDE a Mitsumi CD-ROM (with software bundle) Media Vision Sound board 14 CTX 1468NI 128K Cache and the usual drives ports & OS software.  Since my budget is $2350 for a system it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it IS too good to be true of course). Among other things I've never seen a review of the Budget systems (or their parent company Micro Smart) or of the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be appreciated. In a similar vein the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14 MI monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig benefit here as well. Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities. Email response would be greatly appreciated.

"1","Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5. (The card is revision 5A) My detective work has shown that this jumper simply connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part of the ISA bus. The question I have is simple: To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X what does the manual claim that this jumper does? To anyone with an ISA-reference what is the function of the BALE line? On a related note: Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to the ISA bus?

Ie: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane. Some people don't like these configurations.

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way then it's not compatible.

"1","Hi I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone claims..) Anyway.. 1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use.. 2) Secondly does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ?? 3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8) 4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++).... For instance using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary... I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll suspect not .. 5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant?????? As a follow on does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls 0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to screen memory in terms of portability? Many thanks..

Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard a sound board to make it a MPC- quality station.

"1","Facts: ===== - A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered down for three months. - From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive. - Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a - When powered up the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and pronounced the disk drive unusable. My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders 9 sides). When CMOS set this way COMPSURF runs happily with 13 bad blocks. I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive. Install will proceed successfully but when I try to boot the server it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware. Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit). Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors. Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk yes? So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured? 1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides. Thanks for your time. Apology: ======= I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely.

"1",">How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus? By initiating a DMA xfer.  :) Seriously busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability they don't use the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower). ISA has no bus arbitration so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or crash.(I forget) Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit. The system uses DMA 0 a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1. I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA. In order for them to work properly I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers. I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either. I do know that on EISA/MCA systems you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel. Thanks."
"1","They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use IRQ7!. The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7 then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7. Note this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus although COM's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused!. Windows may be a different story...."
"1","Hi I just got a problem I have a cheapo 2400bps modem which I use to connect to my university but I get too much garbage on the screen. I do know it's because the noise in the line (I can actually hear it).  So my question is will an error correction protocol help to eliminate this garbage? my modem doesn't have any of these on hardware can a software implemented protocol do the trick? Thanks.

"1","The JP5 on the Speedstar 24x is for those systems with boot-up problems. If your system fails to boot-up proprtly please pull off the jumper block from jp5. This will not affect the proformance of the SpeedStar 24x. This is what my manual says about jp5. I never knew that it was there but the card is a real ask kicker in my book.

"1","Hai In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses). It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard. It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is. I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around. My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it so I consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things: - How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2 Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example) - What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it support (text & graphics) - How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM - Compatibility with old TSENG 4000 - Support in software If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell me about it. For the people in Holland: Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam! Thanks in advance			Erik Stel (estel@cs.vu.nl)"

The specs I would like to have is: * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD * SCSI(2) Interface * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B * Does not need any caddies * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible) * Double Speeded I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions are sorted by my priority. I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive but it DOES satisfy almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible with 1542B adapter.

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff is big enough to warrant changing. For instance I'll be upgrading my 486 33 to a 486DX-2 66 EISA VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux) is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're fast enough I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper.

"1","I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX2/66 to run Windows in 1280x1024.  I ordered a 2M ATI Ultra Pro and I'm pretty sure the 2M is really there because I *can* select 1024x768x65536.   But no matter what I do with the Flex program in the ATI's program group 1280x1024 remains ghosted out. I have Windows 3.1 build 59 of the drivers DOS 5.0.

Maybe you need to go into \mach32\install and set a refresh rate for 1280x1024.  You might need to use custom monitor option.

"1","I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK I/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation is no help at all. As an example it says 'The serial port can be changed to COM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-( There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows: C1 C2 S2 P2 P1 G The second bank is labeled IRQ and has the following labels: 5C 5S 4 3 3S 2C 2S I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the G enables the game port and the S2 SHOULD enable the second serial port but I can't get it to work. I have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports but I don;t know how.

"1","I know of two people who have horrer stories about the DOS 6.0. That's 100% of the people I know with DOS 6.0. Both have had to reformat their disks and start over.  One had drive D compress and work fine only to compress C: to have the thing choke spit out an unintelligable warning and then hang.  All that was left on either drive was autoexec.bat and config.sys.  Calls to Microsoft only met with busy signals.  After reformatting the drive I'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a known entity. The other may have been a marginal drive however his upgrade failed he had to format a floppy disk at 6.0 format the drive and then reinstall.

Some BIOSes do not automatically install COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put device=pf.sys in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and such also if that is of any value to you.

"1","Hi Netters As promised here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0. People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0. (Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ) so it's hard to make any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. However it seems that at $39.95 it is quite a buy. Buddy Christyono buddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary of replies ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello Buddy I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance. Here is my suggestion... 1)  If you do not have any compression software currently I would go with DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS) plus the other utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides you are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...) 2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do) the cost is $29.95 for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net I decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost! I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It works great.  Not delays.  I think the A is better than B arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance. I am looking forward to being able to LOADHIGH the DD sw.  That has been an annoyance. 3)  If you have Stacker et.al. currently I would not see it worth the effort to upgrade. Just my $.02 ... Regards Mark Bagdy ---------------------------------------------------------------- Buddy I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The documentation was in my opinion easy to follow. I used the automatic installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly. There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max & QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a 203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had ~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and such). I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very happy camper. -Bruce -- Bruce F.

I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache. I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install. The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive. Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files are compressed image files and some large zip files. If you have any more specific questions let me know. Dan --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40 MB drives.

"1","[] These LPT1 COM1 disk controller are call devices.  There are devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership eg. disk controller (I6) and keyboard (I1).  There are also devices that does not require exclusive ownership ie. it will share an interrupt with another device eg. LPT1 No.  In a standard ISA bus the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to a screwup in the bus design.  For example if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number 7 then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 or 1 at all times depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt. This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7. When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt it's because they're implemented by a single card. -=- Andrew Klossner  (andrew@frip.wv.tek.com)"

I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8 and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If you're really interested though take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file run the P9000 installation program INST and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514 as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use benchmarks from unbiased sources such as testing labs columnists etc. >Interestingly the solid >vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons (ie >filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.

What's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in real applications it lacks the programming elegance of the Bart Simpson optimization in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row.  (We call it the Bart Simpson optimization because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he could right I will not cheat on benchmarks a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.) >I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.

"1","Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup and within minutes of use everything on the screen is totally unintelligible.  Naturally I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers and I told him it was version 1.5 build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so I'm simply amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!). One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now and I have tested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said: Well Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.  Anyway I just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it.  Any feedback will be appreciated. The system configuration is: Gateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus 16 Megs Ram SCSI HD & CD-ROM Ultrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller ATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM DOS 6.0 Windows 3.1 Mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59) Thanks in advance. -- Ali R.

"1","Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card Several problems: 1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB of VRAM which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB VRAM. 2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations: a) Under NDW when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an Open menu) and then is deselected a faint vertical line often remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to be. b) With Word for Windows when you use shading in a table the display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example if you shade the cell as 10% the display is 90% (the printout is OK). 3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command) and the debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed to do). The screen goes haywire and is largely unreadable. The Turbo Debugger display is all garbled. Through trial and error I have found that when the disrupted screen is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter R. This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen and it does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this. The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles the VGA mode. The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use another monitor in place of my usual one. I still like this video card and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty). --- swh 20apr93"

"1","I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm hoping someone knows what this board is or even better what the various switches and jumbers are used for. Anyway here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches 2 banks of 4 switches and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined by following traces that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3 SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4 and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. The only identification printed on the board is MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number but it is blank. Immediately below the words SERIAL NO but not in the box left for the S/N are the numbers 1990 2 8. Anyone have any clues?

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master. In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics. There are four links LK1 LK2 LK4 and LK5 adjacent to the 40 way interface connector. They have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive with the first jumper described nearest the 40 way interface connector. LK2: LED When fitted this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130 Ohms ot 220 Ohms. LK1: Dual Drives This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector indicating to the Master drive the presence of a Slave. LK4: Master When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this way. LK5: IOChRdy When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per second. There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered: Master single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted. Master single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted. Master dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted. Slave dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted. Master dual drive with LED on interface		LK4 LK1 & LK2 fitted. Slave dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted. The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used. The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options.

"1","I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says the board is a 391 WB/H.  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card. Anyway that's all of the pertinent info I can think of. My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays Parity Error -- System Halted messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error Checking to disabled or enabled in the setup of the bios (makes sense). Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?). I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures). I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them in reverse order making sure that the connections were solid. My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/ parallel/game-port I/O card or to the motherboard (God forbid). CAN ANYONE HELP? Thanks Peace David Geller gelldav@elof.acc.iit.edu"

The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence. This is a physical layer concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol. The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or I) physical identification scheme (number). But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number) it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the manufacturer can always retro-fit a board but there could hardly be a reason to ever do that. If your question is actually referring to the IP address it is most definetly changable.  But it is strictly software. Gordon Lang"

The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is in my opinion still the best keyboard around. Function keys on the right place (eh.. left place) firm click etc. Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone? I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality. I.e. the typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. It seams to me that the pins & electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are however the same. Maybe the communication protocol is different? Please answer by e-mail. Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible.

Think! It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks... The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to. An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data. On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time. > > Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book > but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): > > The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board > direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers. > I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter. > So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT > HDD controller doesn't!?!?

This is an interface between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?) claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape. ^^^^^^^^^^ It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200 I think) My question is: Does anybody use this product if yes how many bytes REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite unbelievable to me).

"1","I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs RAM. I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested the card the first time the computer crashed and I got a parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). Well does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it makes the system slow!

"1","Hi everyone I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the program. When I compile the program it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so I can't seem to explain why it crashes. All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing. Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything?? I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce.

Any time I give the modem a reset command [ATZ] while in windows. The computer locks up. If I give the ATZ command in DOS it will work. My solution was to not give the modem the [ATZ] command thru windows. In the PROCOMM + install process I told the program I have a hayes compatible 2400 modem.

"1","Hi: I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs! I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things: -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos) -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos) -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under Windows 3.1 - these images can be large say 2k x 2k 24bits/pixel -	Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of the images/data come from and is the most demanding of these tasks. I've read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup and decided that a nice system (price/performance) would be: 486DX-50 256k cache ISA VLB 16meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 2 meg ram local bus 15 monitor 1280x1024 NI 3Com Etherlink III 16bit Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive However the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these together only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise surprise.  Actually after reading this group I'm surprised that they even have a 50MHz local bus running... I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB  or   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better keeping in mind that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks? Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly so any speedy help would be appreciated even more!!) BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks it has the following configuration: 486DX-33 64k cache ISA 8 meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra+ 2 meg ram 14 monitor 1024x768 NI SMC Ethercard 8 bit Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast ONCE the data gets to it!! ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or been uncovered! There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish running the local window manager.  Also many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram). There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with medium size images. I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it make a difference?  I'm hoping so and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice (above) for that reason. Also are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

"1","In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them). If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80 you can replace the i386 chip with either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing power by about 60% for normal fuctions and not at all for math functions. This chip will only run at your original clock speed ie. if you have a 16MHz machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz. note: Windows does not use the math functions so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows. Or 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100% if you were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed. There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well but I am not sure. If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the 25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a 20MHz 486SX then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz ie. 20MHz externally and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine you will not get faster performance. You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip e-mail me and I will respond with a couple of sources.

"1","Serial cables: There are only three output signals: TD DTR and RTS. There are five inputs signals: RD DSR DCD CTS and RI. There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements. My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG. I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.

It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA which in fact can be utilized by the craphics card. (I have not made measures so someone else may share experience on that.) Also the DX2/66 is faster in the operations that run off internal cache slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory. So my advice is the 66/VLB. | We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast ONCE the data gets to it!! | ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or | been uncovered! | There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!

"1","Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully. Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems you may want to trade elsewhere. Despite the fact that they answer the phone Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're having a GREAT Day! they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return a modem that didn't work as I expected it to. The details: I ordered one of their house brand Infotel 14.4/DF internal FAX modems. In reality it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem I would not have ordered it had I known this in advance. It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was preconfigured) as COM4 providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time. For several reasons I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the time I installed the modem nothing was connected to COM2. Although the modem appeared to work during every connection at 9600 or 14.4 it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support they suggested disabling the COM2 port. This appeared to solve the disconnect problem but was an unacceptable long term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem. I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail hell listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line. I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA number. She promptly switched me to a Tech Support rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings a solution I was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured. Conclusion: I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more than the aggravation or the cost of the modem I gave it to a local charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection. For $30 more I have a solid external modem built by a company I know will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have known better..."

I've never taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers) but from what I've gathered it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier modems are so upgrades in the future may be an issue. again take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated the Sportster so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you want a real answer post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find people who HAVE worked with the Sportster. personally though if I were going to look at the Courier modems I'd buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact this is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right now. and now to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks if you want to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions post them to comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm if someone posts complete and utter bs you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to avoid spreading faulty info). >The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression. just as it does at lower speeds too.  there is absolutely nothing in either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis of course is currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary mode of operation LAPM) but that's about as far as that goes. and just in case there's some confusion on this V.42/V.42bis are also supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one). >The difference >with the Courier is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. take a second look at the original question: >In a previous article cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says: >>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST modem or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST period.  it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST. also not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb. >This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of >the same type unit to achieve this speed. HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about HST we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a proprietary modulation scheme. >The Sportster will do >asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way >only. I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way..... first off V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e. part of the standard).  it isn't a feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter in the Courier DS manual). second HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if you're logged on to say a BBS and type one letter and get screens of info back transfer files (not using bimodem) etc....  there is of course a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions. V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time. third synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics. >The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available. again more correctly put *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large footprint Courier modems (like I do) you're S.O.L.....  there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem. later..... --jim -- #include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W AMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

"1","It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible 486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service: And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80. The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX socket (Pin Grid Array or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds. the 25 the 33 and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board but any software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor. The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance with the cache enabled is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache which is around the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2 compatibility but I didn't test it. The 486DRU2 is not a chip as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX PGA and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available from Cyrix there.  Anyway the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16 and 386DX-20 only.  Double these clock rates and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs. If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50 then they need to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first... I also tested a DLC33 motherboard along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K external cache performance were about 30% faster than the 25 but still significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX. IMHO the DLC is a great low price upgrade for people who can't afford or can't install a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it but if you need 486DX-33 performance the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure about the DLC-40 but I think even if it matches the performance it won't beat it in any significant way. The last time I posted info about the DLC people sent quite a bit of mail asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine: Treasure Chest peripherals they advertise in the Computer Shopper. 1-800-677-9781 The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00 But.... I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier and became a dealer. If you are interested in the chip e-mail me and I can fax or mail you more info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use So I can;t post anymore info here.  However if there are more questions regarding the 486DLC itself I'll post what I can. jamesc 909-396-0408 -- ========================================= If someone asks if you are a God you say...

"1","Hello I've been following discussions on 17 monitors in comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good reviews.  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products as well as some others that may fit the bill. I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI. I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large (=>17) if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been very happy with a 16 on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home. I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are Mag and Viewsonic. Ok stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are the products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. what scan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  What's list and street cost - if avail. from a third party and where can I get ahold of them?

"1","==== BEGIN REPOST ==== IBM Apple Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week as Motorola Corp. IBM and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit processor with a 64-bit memory interface much like Intel Corp.'s Pentium with the capability of performing as many as three instructions per clock cycle according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two configurations running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50 SPECint89 marks respectively sources said. Floating-point performance for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better as their SPECfp89 performance will be 60 and 80 respectively. The 601 a scaled-down version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000 workstations will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus built in. The chip which is being designed initially to support the Micro Channel Architecture is bus independent so vendors could develop PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures including ISA EISA or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design one source noted. According to sources familiar with the development effort Motorola has been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive architecture despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s 486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100 one source said. ==== END REPOST ===="

"1","FOR SALE: AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax v.42 v.42bis and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression so you can get error-free links up to 57600 bps on a conventional phone line.  They will fall back to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems. It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (Windows OS/2 Unix etc). They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible. These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free too) from AT&T. They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics etc.  The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts). I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including Zoom US Robotics etc).  And it is backed by a company that will never go away. This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping or you can stop by my home to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal modem let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.) If you're interested please let me know.  This is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice. If you have questions about this AT&T has an info number at (800) 554-4996 or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them. The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

While I am aware there are various BBS's and other similar services avalible (like Compuserve Canada Remote Systems etc.) I require fairly specific criteria. In approximate order of importance they are: 1) The mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(NOTE: all users are remote and will use modems over conventional phone lines.) 2) Simple. The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge have never heard of Unix and have very little interest in learning. It is essential that the client software is completely pain-free. 3) Cheap. We would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established commercial network just so we can send large files between members of the group - hence (1). In addition I would like the network server to be something small simple and inexpensive like a 486.

Ok I have a Local Bus 486/66 machine with the Crystal Scan 15inch monitor.  I have 1 meg of loca memory on the ATI ultra pro w/ the mach32 driver (the newest release). My problem is in Windows when I use the 1024 mode. I get shadows down the sides of the screens and very blurry type in the corners.  The types on the screen are all out of focus. I've gotten replacement video cards and a replacement monitor.  None of that has helped though. Could someone pleae help me with this very frustruating problem.

I know how to set the jumpers on the 40M to be slave and the settings for heads wpcom sectors etc. I also know that I have to do some CMOS settings and fdisk. The problem is: what letter will the CMOS give the new drive? If it's D: what will happen when Stacker creates D: and swap? Can I tell CMOS to make it E:? So that if I Stack it I will have C D E and F? I know this could be an FAQ or in a readme somewhere but I want to hear from somebody who've actually done it. Thanks! Romy"

The motherboard manufacturer where I usually buy boards says >that they will have this problem fixed in about two weeks... >| Brian J Schaufenbuel I don't see this as a problem with the chip-set (a mistake) I see this as something that was designed-in intentionally. So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA) would require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may begat an update to the motherboard board design. What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this off as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple. If I were you I would be cautious about this. You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA motherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are VL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real' 32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board. Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother- board.  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it.  I'm attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the AIR board. Model number of AIR board (with 486-33DX) is B433EI2.

"1","Hello I'm trying to use the BIOS timer interrupts (which occur every .055 seconds or 18.2 times a second) to time people's response times in a psychology experiment and the response times are on the order of .01 seconds. Is there any way I can get better precision than by counting ticks? Or can I make the ticks occur more frequently? I'm trying to do this in DOS 5.0 on a 386 and it would be nice if this could also work on our old 8086 machines running DOS 2.1 (I know I know I don't like them any more than you do) but this is by no means a requirement just a possibility.

"1","I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday and installed it into my Gateway DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5 (the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation program recommended IRQ2 but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2 or should I choose a different one? Right now I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this cascade to IRQ8-15 business? A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that only DMA 5 6 7 are 16 bit DMAs and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about 32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus extension to do 32-bit DMA? Yet another question after installing PAS16 my Links (golf game) will hang the machine when I select SB mode and run but works with Adlib mode?? Civilization however works fine ( at least so far). Any body knows what I might have done wrong? Thanks (I am obviously a newbie) -- John"

Now I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4 2E8 IRQ3. To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC I have to configure the modem as COM3 2E8 IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that allows that the FAX program that came with the modem does not work. Anyway I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set as COM4... I did run a few diagnostic programs and they did not help at all: a few displayed the modem as COM4 and others displayed it as being COM3.

"1","I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5 drives in particular the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112. There is also the Maxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm 1.2 gig) drive. They are all quite cheap and have nice 3-5 year warranties. My questions are: Is there a catch? Which one is better? What type of SCSI-2 do these drives use? Is the service generally better for one of these manufacturers? Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason? thanks Michael Taylor"

On one he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter and it worked fine (rather he sent in the coupon for the converter). In other cases I've run the doublespace installation without a problem when compressing a new drive compressing free space or whatever else.

All tests were made on the same >computer with the same disk no cache and the same (big) files were used. Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin load before anything else.  With Stacker any changes to your config.sys or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those. Personally I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those hooks and stuff.  Plus the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay but I much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive. >But DOS 6 is quite good; reformat disks? I honestly don't understand WHY >you had to do this. Ditto. koberg"

When I dismantled it I discovered that it is really just a standard RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc. Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs so I connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of. The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines. The display rolls continuously but does change modes (OK only to CGA - but useful for my laptop). Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors? I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that he has had several enquiries of this sort but Phillips Computer is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway? A UK support dealer said Circuit diagrams? Sync? So any ideas.

"1","HI that might look like a dull request but I have been following this newgroup for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind. I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!). The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only problem is that it is quite slow. I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot of comments on many products over the last weeks but didn't get an overall picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest. I would like to get information about : - the refresh rates the various cards provide; - quality of windows drivers; - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff). Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip info but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied with it  let me know. If this information is of any use here is my system configuration: - Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard) - monitor DARIUS 14 non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768) (can reach 70kHz horizontally) I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent enough to record settings. Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me Guy Lamouche lamouche@ere.umontreal.ca"

I've also spoken to a few people who run standard local bus video cards at 50 mhz without trouble (and a couple of people who couldn't get a lb card to work at that speed). -Brian bjoppy@ucdavis.edu"

"1","Gateway service has confirmed my suspicion echoed by a couple of people who responded to the original request for help.  The ATI VLB video board uses the addresses for COM 4.  They could suggest no work around. I will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM 4 (even though it could not possibly work) for credit against a bus mouse.  This will free up the COM port I need - too bad the original salesman who suggested either the DF IO card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know enough about the hardware. Otherwise I must say that the 486DX2/66 system has worked very well - no problems with any other hardware or software. John Siegel k4bnc@cbnewsh.att.com"

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE it depends on the drive you use and the board you use.

"1","Howdy I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro 286/12 with a Phoenix replacement BIOS in order to support an IDE hard drive and a high-density 3.5 floppy. I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure but I have encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit responsibilty for and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it. Everything is hunky-dory except the 3.5 floppy which will read but NOT WRITE diskettes.  Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs. I have tried everything I can think of.

"1","Organization: Compact Solutions Canberra ACT Australia I have a floppy drive which has developed General failure errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5 drive). I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now. However it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk) the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector. Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it. Thanks!

"1","Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.

My guess is that all the other monitors come with their own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to send me some literature and will report back to the net after I've studied it.

My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Simple.  First Andrew is correct although I can see where there might be some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time. Here is an example.  For some time I was short of free interrupts.  I had a tape controller (not a floppy tape) that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an *old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2 where my modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced it would most likely hang.)  Likewise when the tape backup software runs it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for the serial port. Under DOS printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7. Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-) -- Kenneth R. Ballou				VOICE:		 (617) 494-0990 Oberon Software Inc.

"1","Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5 hard drive model LPS240A and have a concern about its behavior. Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to file I/O it performs what I call phantom seeks. When the PC is absolutely idle I can hear a spurt of activity in the drive every 30-40 seconds lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card not the drive.] My other hard disk a Seagate ST3283A does not have this kind behavior. Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon? -- --------------------- Steve Harrold			swh@cup.hp.com HPG200/11 (408) 447-5580 ---------------------"

I tried to install a 2400 buad Hayes internal modem but it doesnt work.  Once I dial any number the system locks.  I do not hear any click or ring before it the system hangs.  The modem has a 2 pin dip switch to select the appropriate port.  Once I change the settings on the dip switch the system starts working again. Then I bought a 2400 baud Hayes external modem and checked the system.  It works fine with both the serial ports.

This is a common misconception shared my many manufacturers programmers and users alike.  COM3 for example is simply the third equipped COMM port not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The first equipped port it finds will become COM1 etc.  If you're playing by the rules you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set of standard (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for serial ports. So what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were this address in the 4th table slot instead programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 COMM ports installed.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port 2. X terminals 3. NeXT 4. Silicon Graphics 5. IBM RS/6000 6. Other stuff 1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard (Sun HP DEC etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation runs the X window system you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used PC hook your expensive keyboard up to it and run a serial cable to your workstation.  Then run a program on the workstation to read the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events. The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X. a2x is a sophisticated program capable of controlling the mouse and even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server extension (XTEST DEC-XTRAP or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your server can do this run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this you may want to investigate compiling X11R5 patchlevel 18 or later or bugging your vendor. kt is a simpler program which should work with unextended X servers. Another program called xsendevent also exists but I haven't seen it. Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu. 2. X terminals Also a number of X terminals (NCD Tektronics to name a few) use PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal you may be all set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also some X terminals add extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key. 3. NeXT NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop Bus meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then they announced they were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of upgrade for an older NeXT do it now! 4. Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards except by upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more details. 5. IBM RS/6000 IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  || Unfortunately you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  || cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   || smaller PS/2 style DIN-6 and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe || it or not IBM wrote this device driver recently I used it and it || works.  However they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  || told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn || anything new please send me e-mail.				    || 6. Other stuff Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp) support some odd keyboard types and may be responsive to your queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either from the vendor or with a storage oscilloscope) you may be in luck.  Contact the companies for more details. Apple Adjustable Keyboard Apple Computer Inc. Sales offices all over the place.

The keyboard has one section for each hand and the sections rotate backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion. The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard. A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions. The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests which are not directly attachable to the keyboard. As soon as soda comes back up I'll have a detailed blurb from TidBITS available there.

Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products. Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number of popular word processors and spreadsheets. Each user `trains' the system to their voice and there are provisions to correct the system when it makes mistakes on the fly.  Multiple people can use it but you have to load a different personality file for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard too. On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute. I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.

Big backlog -- could take 3+ months. Price: $2000/unit (1 unit == 2 pods). (new price!)			    || Each hand has its own pod.  Each of the four main fingers has five switches each: forward back left right and down.  The thumbs have a number of switches.  Despite appearances the key layout resembles QWERTY and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod tilts in its base to act as a mouse.

You purchase compatibility modules a new cord and possibly new keycaps and then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines. It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the standard 101-key keyboard except sliced into three sections.  Each section is on a custom telescoping universal mount.  Each section independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three sections too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections flat and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

"1","Archive-name: typing-injury-faq/software Version: 1.8 7th December 1992 This FAQ is actually maintained by Richard Donkin <richardd@hoskyns.co.uk>. I post it along with the other FAQ stuff.  If you have questions you want to send mail to Richard not me.  -- Dan Software Tools to help with RSI ------------------------------- This file describes tools primarily software to help prevent or manage RSI. This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches... Please let me know if you know any other tools or if you have information or opinions on these ones and I will update this FAQ. I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them. Richard Donkin Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) Fax: +44 71 251 2853 Changes in this version: Added information on StressFree another typing management tool for Windows. TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to warn of a break others use beeps or screen messages. Often RSI appears only after many years of typing and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises you don't have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is getting RSI. Tool: At Your Service (commercial software) Available from: Bright Star Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697 Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4) Windows Description: Provides calendar keyboard watch email watch and system info. Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations on posture and exercises.  Sound-oriented will probably work best with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible to record your own messages to warn of break. Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software) Available from: Media Vision Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563 Platforms: PC Description: A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port. Includes 'At Your Service'. Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software) Available from: Escape Ergonomics Inc 1111 W. El Camino Real Suite 109 Mailstop 403 Sunnyvale CA Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410 Platforms: DOS Description: Aimed at preventing RSI this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval based on clock time or after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier. It gives you 3 exercises to do each time randomly selected from a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do - data entry word processing information processing. Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does. CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer. A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included. CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows but does not then warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear useful when used with Windows. Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts site licenses. Comments: The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for RSI management tools. Tool: EyerCise (commercial software) Available from: RAN Enterprises One Woodland Park Dr. Haverhill MA  01830 US Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only) Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS] Description: Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training exercises can configure which are included and how many repetitions you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help on workplace ergonomics. Quote from their literature: EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work all parts of your body relieving tension and helping to prevent Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these help you to become more relaxed and productive. The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C. Godnig O.D. and John S. Hacunda which describes the ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use. Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling quantity discounts for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US). Comments: I have a copy of this and it works as advertised: I would say it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management because it does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC and has one window without window controls.  Very usable though and does not require any sound hardware. Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software) Available from: Visionary Software P.O. Box 69447 Portland OR  97201 US Tel: +1 (503) 246-6200 Platforms: Mac DOS (Windows version underway) Description: Aimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break with dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises to do during breaks and information on configuring your workstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59; quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is bought in from another company apparently; not sure how equivalent this is to the Mac version. The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful 2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions with references. Tool: StressFree (commercial software free usable demo) Available from: LifeTime Software P.O. Box 87522 Houston Texas 77287-7522 US Tel: 800-947-2178 (US only) Fax: +1 (713) 474-2067 Mail: 70412.727@compuserve.com Demo (working program but reduced functions) available from: Compuserve: Windows Advanced Forum New Uploads section or Health and Fitness Forum Issues At Work section. Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites) Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway) Description: Aimed at preventing RSI this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the correct rate.  Quite a few exercises can configure which ones are included to some extent.  Online help. Version 2.0 is out soon Mac and DOS versions will be based on this. Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet otherwise $39.95. Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each. (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0). Comments: I have had a play with this and it works OK.  Its user interface design is much better in 2.0 though still a bit unusual. expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only tool with a redistributable demo so if you do get the demo post it on your local bulletin boards FTP servers and Bitnet servers! Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises. Tool: Typewatch (freeware) version 3.8 (October 1992) Available from: Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO SunOS Mach; character and X Window mode) Description: This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously typing.  It does not provide exercises but it does check that you really do take a break and tells you when you can start typing again. Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today each time it warns you which is useful so you know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out. The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode) in a pop-up window (for X Windows) or as a Zephyr message (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for X Zephyr and Mach. Not formally supported but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk (for SCO SunOS character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach X Window mode Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give feedback. Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs Available from: Various sources Platforms: Various Description: Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool. Or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen. Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file and include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you want to have breaks every 30 minutes starting from 9 am. Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment enter 9:30 hit Enter and type some text in saying what the break is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment. By using Windows Recorder you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this file on your 'run=' line as above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments with RSI exercises. The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will depend a lot on your operating system. While these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating system using batch jobs or whatever fits best. Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers Available from: Various sources e.g. Casio BP-100. Description: Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically. While these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you are writing reading driving or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing. Comments: My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day. I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period! KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout. One-handed typing tools may help but be VERY careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing and may therefore make matters worse. Tool: hsh (public domain) Available from: Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones) Description: Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings. Only works through tty's (so you can use it with a terminal or an xterm but not most X programs). Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various) Available from: Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c Also built into Windows 3.x. Description: The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent RSI a bit but you can also use it if you have RSI since it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-) -- Dan Wallach               One of the most attractive features of a Connection dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces Office#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet. -- CM Paris Ref.

As soon as you possibly can.  The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR. The remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational Safety and Health Service): Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and Rehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide. First a glossary (or fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands): (note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :) RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below) Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint. Pronation: Turning the palm down. Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up. Supination: Turning the palm up. Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down. Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil. Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger. Power grip: The grip used for a hammer. Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb. Abduction: Moving away from the body. Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide. Now then problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt. Diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they're not necessarily the problem. --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory. Normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power you're completely restricting your blood flow. Without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid which cause pain. Once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues. Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves.  They need blood too. Anyway when you're typing too much you're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things worse. --- Specific injuries you may have heard of: (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.) Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability to lubricate the tendon.  As a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you've got your problem. Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation.  Eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more pain.  Sub-acute tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive activity. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation. CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition. Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension' this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy). Others: for just about every part of your body there's a fancy name for a way to injure it.  By now you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery). ==4== Typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax. If you're under a load of stress this is doubly important.  Tune out the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break. EVERY THREE MINUTES TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really do it every three minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax. If you can't sleep you really need to focus on this.  Rest sleep and relaxation are really a big deal. There are all kinds of other treatments of course.  Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best for you. --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10. -- dwallach] . Let your shoulders relax. . Let your elbows swing free. . Keep your wrists straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try leaning back in the chair. . Don't slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minutes get up and bend your spine backward. Set the seat height first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much. Now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at.  If you are short this may be impossible.  The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest. Now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area. If you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available. [Now I diverge a little from the text] A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair go find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you. In the San Francisco Bay Area I highly recommend Just Chairs.  The name says it all. --- Keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements: There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some people wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However with good posture you shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be right there.  If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work: how you sit how you type and how you relax.  It's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands. Some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed.  A number of replacements are available on the market today. Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail. ==5== Requests for more info Clearly the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive is incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like to submit something please send me mail and I'll gladly throw it in. If you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors that would be wonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd love somebody to make a list of doctors.

I'm sure there are HMOs in which the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctor's income.  In most however including the one I work for there is no direct incentive to under-order.  Profits of the group are shared among all partners but the group is so large that an individual's generated costs have a miniscule effect.  I don't believe that we under-order.

I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances). Clearly they faked a lot of the computer & robotic technology; certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself let alone the idea of a space germ. Quite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to see the movie again] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _How'd They Do That?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's top lab.  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken so that building will never be cracked so to speak by man or nature (short of deliberate bombing from the air perhaps).  And the researchers used spacesuits similar to that in the film. I'm curious what people think about this film -- short of silly. Is such a facility technically feasible today?

"2","SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL By Laura Pitter TUZLA Bosnia Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August. But after treating 4000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody war he considers himself a surgeon. ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.'' Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there. ``I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce'' he told reporters. Mujanovic 31 had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says he has performed major surgery 1396 times relying on books for guidance amputating arms and legs 150 times usually without anesthetic delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections. He worked 18-to-19-hour days slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4000 patients. He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain he said. His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of the dead were women and children. The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street'' he said. ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no heads.'' Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools facilities and medicine. The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.'' Once he arrived the situation improved he said but by mid-September he had run out of supplies. ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands'' he said. Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding. ``People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations'' he said. Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types. ``I felt destroyed psychologically'' Mujanovic said. The situation improved after Dec. 4 when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres. But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.'' Then the hunger set in. Between mid-December and mid-March when U.S. planes began air dropping food between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition he said. ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation'' he said. According to Mujanovic around 5000 people died in Srebrenica 1000 of them children during a year of siege. Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife who is ill in Tuzla. ``They say I'm a hero'' he said. ``There were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road crying and waving when I left. And I cried too.'' -- Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham MA  USA e-mail: sharon@world.std.com"

I'm >trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated. >Thanks. You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which are used for chemotherapy. The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy cancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different effects on cancer cells and therefore it is not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time. Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle. The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis and RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase S synthesis of DNA occurs. The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized aagain.  In the fourth phase M (or Mitosis) the cell may divide. There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis. Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis. At any rate the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells to stop growing. If what you are seeking is practical advice I apologize for rambling on the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs are rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small frequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines tthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications can be given and good skincare and fluid intake are important. Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always happen.  It depends on what drugs are being given and on the person themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different side effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss presumably by reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this too I would love to see it and possibly some bib data. I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society. They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition if your friend has had a mastectomy I highly recommend Reach for Recovery. It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast because of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions. If you have further questions please send me E-mail.  I hav some good access to information and I enjoy trying to help other people. I wish the best to you and your friend."

If you want to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive. the best SCSI-2 FASTWIDEetc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive. All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2 drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces. IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance. SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed. neither one is better in all cases.

Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer. If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!) So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk and REM out the Adaptec drivers. Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the right order.. it will work. Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you are off to more REM statements and more fun. The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

From what I've seen in coursework most CPUs never actually idle.  They will continue to service interrupts etc. etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it's doing. I suppose depending on the instruction the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging the change in temperature to the immediate environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be negligible.

"2","I have a 42 yr old male friend misdiagnosed as having osteopporosis for two years who recently found out that his illness is the rare Gaucher's disease. Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up. This will eventually cause death. Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable improvement in their condition. Ceredase which is manufactured by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380000 per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called the most expensive disease in the world. NEED INFO: I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying on netlanders to provide me with any additional information: **news stories reports **people you know with this disease **ideas articles about Genzyme Corp how to get a hold of enough money to buy some programs available to help with costs. **Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER Thanks so very much!

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall but significant.  Personally I'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common and even a small increase in risk is significant there. -- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   = =  General Internal Medicine      |      ...dammit not a programmer!  = =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-="

Times have changed and our attitudes >need to change with them. Well yes.  That was a part of my point.  Aspirin has its problems but in some situations it is useful.  Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile. Like Prozac for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use that long and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time even though it has been tested by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects if any are not known?

If this is what it is she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up and drive me nuts too but nowadays I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are but you get so used to it it just gets tuned out.  Yes this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience. >Does anyone know of any treatments for this?  Any experience?  Coping >mechanisms?  Any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs? Millions have it according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious. The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress but I haven't changed my lifestyle much and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat but now I rarely notice it when it really kicks in). Also it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam and passed.  In fact my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should. Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus chances are good she'll begin to not even notice it.

"2","My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  I bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probably enough along with the usual good diet.  However he is on at me to get some product called Dalacin T which used to be a doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the chemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T or that Clearasil is OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager nothing serious.  His father was the same so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about their appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from acne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.

I am hoping that the arrival of (1) Spring Break and (2) College Acceptance Letters will help.  *UNFORTUNATELY* she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend so it seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-( Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for spring break which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.

The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew. The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear. Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5000 or 6000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies colds infections and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines usually) can help.

I do not know a lot about this except from seeing one patient with Kartagener's syndrome which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus bronchiectasis and chronic infections. Situs inversus means that organs are on the wrong side of the body and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the normal rotation associated with ciliary motion so that in absence of this laterality can be random. People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools because of their rarity and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side). According to Harrison's immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this and as usual in medicine we may be talking about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist of which there is probably one at NCSU. -km"

What is the mechanism and why would a physician >call for chest xrays to diagnose the cause of the clubbing? Purists often distinguish between true clubbing and pseudo clubbing the difference being that with true clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With pseudo clubbing the angle is initially positive then negative which is the normal situation. Real internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes. Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly only true clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization. The cause of clubbing is unclear but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally. Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often however the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent. -km"

There are many organisms viral bacterial and fungal which can cause meningitits and the course of these infections varies widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause. What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the meningococcus and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases) the organism typically causes death within a day. This organism feared as it is is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways but blood borne spread is probably the usual case. Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis by the way. Sorry but I don't have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis is a huge topic and sci.med can't do it justice. -km"

It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.

"2","I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly (motrin at the time) I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches because I've found them to be ineffective.  However I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago) so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos) but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only real solution to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin that doesn't work and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago so I'm through with it).  In fact Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain. The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs Xrays CT scan and EMGs (I've had 2 of them and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging degeneratig disks and from the Xrays (and MRI I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4 and L4-L5) but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah I had some other horrible test called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine.   Anyway the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse so I'd always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago. Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources that force me to use them (Oh I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally I have to take off work but usually I can work but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad I can't concentrate much I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad it can cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines an average of 3 to 4 a month which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage) but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becomes available I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal) but they either didn't work or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain which I agree with most of the time but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine) and I've already had surgery several times. Anyway the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain. Janice Rathmann"

Very little acne as a teenager. I didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease on my face not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat). Keeping hair rinse mousse dip and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness. Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards. Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples). -Jackie-"

"2","I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south) but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from painful experience: 1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person. Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs. 2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear that these things will itch for months. 3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is required to get it. 4. Based on my experience and that of my family members the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation. 5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well. A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally applied to ankles waistband etc. is a good start.  There is another preparation called Chig Away that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.) 6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried. Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think it gains nothing). 7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs and this seems to speed recovery as well. Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money. -- Gary H.

Make sure to >tell the pharmacist that you want the Physicians' Package Insert *NOT* the If people are going to do this I really wish they would tell me first. I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to go ballistic but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses such as migraine and hypertension this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to ask the system we hope. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now however with a virulent resistant strain we are in more trouble and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

I seem to recall reading somewhere that this was believed to have been viral in nature but I don't know for sure. However I have been curious since then about this.

"2","The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER- MONGERING medical establishment. Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in the following article: NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES A 3RD OPINION ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. ) DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of this list is NOT a doctor of any kind but is exercising his First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the subjects of his choice. ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store. MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food Store.  What is important is HOW they are used and what else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. ) (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want one kind at a time preferably grapes. 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want at least half raw including GARLIC; also whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings. 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune juice WITH PULP followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from concentrate) apple juice then grape juice.  (Stay close to your home bathroom.) 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and dried fruit you want preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS CONTAIN LAETRILE.). 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled) and add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey (NO sugar). Drink one glass per hour. [EVERYone including healthy people should do this one day every week preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH PULP.] 6th day: Same as 5th day. 7th day: Same as 6th day. All 7 days eat ONLY the foods listed above for each day along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. (2) THE GRAPE DIET. Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours 8 AM to 8 PM every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the six days but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR. Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple cider flavored vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it. Do this 3 or 4 times per day for 3 weeks; then stop for a week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a FUNGUS as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.] Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in. Immerse yourself in it for a minute and then completely dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes while exercising your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down chomping your teeth together etc.. Among other things the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of X-rays etc. as described in the book Born To Be Magnetic Vol. 2 by Frances Nixon 1973. PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should prepare it and drain it. For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath stay away from and even out of sight of other people.  (Your greatly expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath eat at least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures. (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet take a 2-Billion-bacteria Acidophilus capsule which is also an EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF A.I.D.S. (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal bacteria it may also be a CURE for Lyme disease.] Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm within 3 days of a full moon nor during Major or Minor Periods as listed in the Solunar Tables published bimonthly in Field & Stream Magazine (because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields present at those times). Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: For skin cancer apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the affected skin twice daily and take 2 to 4 tablespoons per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally for about 2 months. D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to perform NORMAL cell functions. ALMONDS (UN-blanched UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE. To help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day. To help cure cancer eat several OUNCES of almonds per day. [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally. IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is ALSO present in the digestive system.)] ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS and include Vitamin E Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most people.) Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day) Vitamin A (25000 IU per day is safe for most people.) Superoxide Dismutase (up to 4000000 Units per day) Vitamin C (up to 3000 mg. per day) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy- toluene) [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types) suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes prevent spreading herpes to other people but will not cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST A.I.D.S. which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia.]  (See the book Life Extension by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day hours before or after eating or drinking anything else. Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day. Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants described above. VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective and much less expensive when COMBINED together in MEGA doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100000 Maxwell) NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD especially if it is pulsating on and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion ALL types of ionizing- radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100000-Maxwell NORTH magnetic fields. Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos of cancer tumors etc. with-OUT X-rays! INTERFERON tablets. TAHEEBO TEA (Lapacho). HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer and many other medical problems (even drug addiction!). 50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure prostate trouble. This list is NOT exhaustive. The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN- DIAGNOSED cancers as well as PREVENT them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart- diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work effectively. Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet send a strong message to one's subconscious mind PROGRAMMING it to CURE the cancer. In my opinion if a person finds out that s/he has cancer then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies described above in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast) BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations and agonies [POISON BURN and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

Well making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe that doing your own research is very very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me. I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor get a diagnosis maybe get a second opinion and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in this field in the country I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact HEADING that support group) was helpful for a while but after a point I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself. A recent movie Lorenzo's Oil offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it you should.  It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm or a weak heart or failing kidneys I might not have the same opinion.  That's because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments.  With dizziness you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it. I have chosen the latter.

Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule' after him and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more. I don't think extra-scientific is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction. For example Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich) looking at the same phenomenon had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid. Again Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the Newton of mirror-image life which he never admitted publically. Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro which the student eventually did whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which in 15 or so years produced the famous discovery (Avery MacLeod and McCarty JEM 1944). -- Mark A.

"2","We were talking about Migraine and Exercise (I'm the one who can't fathom the thought of exercise during migraine...).  Anyway turning the thread around the other day I played tennis during my lunch hour.  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  I got overheated and dehydrated.  Afterwards I noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later I could feel a migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.) I took cafergot but it didn't help and the pain started although it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night the pain subsided. This isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exercise. I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder what triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?). I'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do (besides get into shape and don't play at high noon) to prevent this?

For me there is a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat which appears to be totally limitless and the purely conscious desire to not put on too much weight. When I get too fat I just diet/exercise more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range but smaller and larger cycles occur as well. I'm always afraid that this method will stop working someday but usually I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check. This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting (that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle- dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change. I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.

I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted in the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy is available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000 GPs who use homeopathic practices. True? False? What? Have there been any important and documented investigations into homeopathic principles? I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. I turned to the section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine and two paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide any sort of explanation. The author stated this with pride as though it were some sort of virtue! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy? Is it because I am a narrow-minded bigot or is it because homeopathy really looks more like witch-doctory than anything else? Daniele."

"2","Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. And in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house. In science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata --- the search for scope and the search for certainty. If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless what Newton and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made.

These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology.  According to these posters  If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science. Taken to the extreme I believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science. For one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results I think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come with anything worthwhile. Furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance. For instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative. (One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology.  In my opinion a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's assertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors.) I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

Hi Janet Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance same onset symptoms same cafergot uselessness same duration.  In fact of all the people I know who have migraines none have been so similar.  There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned about mine but since ours seem to be alike here are my observations. I don't think it's heat per se (I've had more in winter than summer). Dehydration could conceivably figure though.  Try tanking up before playing rather than after. Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much either. I've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in descending order of importance): 1) Heavy exercise 2) Sleep deprivation 3) Fasting		(e.g. skipped breakfast) 4) Physical trauma	(e.g. head bonk) Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines but I don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of the other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered this I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two or three years when I get cocky (It's been so long maybe I just don't get them anymore) and stop being careful. Hope this is helpful. John."

"2","A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis as a result of trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago.  The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not. Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines but the effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months. As a result of the pain my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it. The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis. My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words not mine). If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis alternative courses of action support groups or literature on it I would be extremely grateful if you could e-mail to me.

"2","I love the FAQ. The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why is this?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well? Also why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of only about 5% of the corneal depth while RK is done to a depth of up to 95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not be understanding all of the differences. In the FAQ the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than with glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the intentional slight undercorrection then it can be compensated for when necessary with glasses (or contacts if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It is important to know if that is not the case however and some other consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  The first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense which glasses couldn't help. would not help. -- | Daniel R.

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of progress and rationality in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past I won't go into them again now. What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the correct) approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes forward (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the critical function of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally true of the application of any critical function concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an anything goes view.) True the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science. -- Gary H.

INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language courses this summer.  Both courses Intensive Elementary Japanese and Intensive Intermediate Japanese are ten week ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week five hours per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course. Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact Steven Brener Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below. ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## ####################################################################### JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States.  It is also designed to let scientists engineers and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts. PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly JSTMP consists of three major components: 1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time. 2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology Sociology History and Political Science.  Moreover seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled. 3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however shorter ones are possible. FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea up to 8 I think and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't cut in PRK it vaporizes. In RK the eye is cut into. >In the FAQ the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than >with glasses alone.

I find my vision is more clear for some things and less clear for others only at night. I notice a definite haloing at night in the darkness when I look at automobile headlamps though this is not something I spend inordinate amounts of time doing.

Boy you computer people only know 1s and 0s but not much about logic. :-) No. I did not said MSG was not the culprit. What I argued was that that there was enough reasonable doubt to convict MSG.

Look people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant. I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt. What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from a recent FDA hearing: ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect on the brain'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition not science'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.'' And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not. Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high that some blame it for anything and everything. My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue although I am probably 20-1 outnumbered. Jason Chen"

Why such a difference? In myopia the cornea is too curved.  There is too much of a bulge in the center. In PRK the laser removes a small amount of material from the center. In RK the surgeon cuts incisions near the edge.  They heal and the scarring reshapes the cornea. Entirely different mechanisms and the action is in a different place. -dk"

"2","I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me.  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain. He suggested medication and a course of treatment and told me that I need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness as well as my general health. I did exactly as he asked and made the call (reaching his secretary). I explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective. The doctor called me back and his first words were Whatever you want you'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit- chat with you!  I told him I was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him and that I was feeling worse.  I then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time.  He responded Just spit it out now because no time is a good time.  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered and then said well never mind and he said he'll talk to various colleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time. This doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express myself well he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I was pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told me that he just doesn't have time to rap with patients and thought that was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to rap was insulting and said again that I was just following through on his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me this apology: I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you mistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you but I am not that knowledgeable about pain and I don't have a lot of time to deal with that.  He then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication. I am still upset and have not yet called. My questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care? (2) Since I am in pain off and on I realize that this may cause me to be more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive? If this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type of pain I have he still wants me to status him on my condition but now I am afraid to call him. --Marlena"

"2","The subject-line says it:  every time I run a fever I get an amazing rosy rash over my torso and arms.  Fortunately it doesn't itch. The rash  always comes on the day after the fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold flu whatever. It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything. Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever: a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever seems to bring rashes that go away faster. Anybody know what might be causing this?  It's no more than an embarassment but I'd be curious to know what's going on.  Am I carrying some kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out its competition? Jim Jones"

I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance. I don't react to scallops but did have discomforts with clam juice served at (American) waterfront seafood bars.

Ten years ago about an hour after having Won Ton Soup I collapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up my scalp tingling my feet too weak to stand up.  The symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes.  Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction I went back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish.  The same thing happened.  A quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothing out of the ordinary. I've also had a mild attack after having soup at a Thai restuarant."

Well I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also extra-scientific etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality.  In terms of examples there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a surprising experiment is what counts as surprising etc. The same may be said about logical grounds.  My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his sea of air hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) surprising? Well given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of perfectly rational grounds?  Well there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it new?  Well one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you like. -- Gary H.

"2","INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language courses this summer.  Both courses Intensive Elementary Japanese and Intensive Intermediate Japanese are ten week ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week five hours per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course. Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact Steven Brener Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below. ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## ####################################################################### JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States.  It is also designed to let scientists engineers and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts. PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly JSTMP consists of three major components: 1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time. 2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology Sociology History and Political Science.  Moreover seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled. 3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however shorter ones are possible. FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Reproduced without permission.] Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors Although the _miracle berry_ a plant native to West Africa is practically tasteless it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle berries contain a protein _miraculin_ that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk Gentile Moskowitz & Meiselman 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry (and I do recommend it) for about the next half an hour all acids (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste sour as well. Miraculin was for a time commercially available in the United States as a diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened slightly acidic substances.  Such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories. A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries. We drank straight lemon juice sauerkraut juice even vinegar.  All tasted extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis. Of course cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas among many other problems as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and in men gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant. Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected at least statistically in your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you and offer you support. Simon."

Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them I'm making them too) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific research.  That is that you make empirical observations form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than the old Newtonian model of the world.  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical world view.  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. >It is also important to distinguish reason from science. Science may be >reasonable but so are many non-scientific methodologies. Aristotle reasoned >that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle. Oversimplified of course but a good example.  This is an empirical observa- tion.  It was then tested though perhaps not by Aristotle and eventually found wanting.  In the meantime some folk will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life. There's nothing at all surprising about this it's the way the gathering of knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base even idiotic to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories. Again I think it gets down to defining what you mean by science.  I often don't recognize what it is that I do and am involved in in the way science is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They portray science as a collection of immutable facts pronouncements of TRUTH in big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab turn over a stone and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula- tion.  Its much more interesting than that.  It really is a very human process."

"2","A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post the following information. A few weeks ago she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out. (by the way she is 29 or 30 years old). It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar.  Since that time she  has gotten two more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue. She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal. She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea? ** By the way in case you are going to ask...no she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no she hasn't recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm coloring or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out. Thanks in advance for any help!"

This is a lovely area for anecdotes but I am sure you are on to something. As a physician I almost never get sick: usually when something horrendous is going around I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case. When I do get really sick it is always something unusual. This was not the situation when I was in medical school particularly on pediatrics. I never had younger siblings myself and when I went on the pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam! I think what happens is that during training and beyond we are constantly exposed to new things and we have the usual reactions to them so that later on when challenged with something it is more likely a re-exposure for us so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I don't think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way. Also don't forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home and we carry a lot of that around. -km"

Not to drag this out anymore but.... Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness swollen joints +/- fever. A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been an ellusive matter for researchers and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease. Up to now only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to prove that the disease exists. This paper is noteworthy in two other regards: 1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure.  After this period none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So these are proven clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't have the same chronicity that some see in humans. 2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy. Anyway maybe we will see some independent scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so. -- Jeff Parke <jeffp@pgavin1.vetmed.wsu.edu> also:   jeffp@WSUVM1.bitnet    AOL: JeffParke Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine class of 1994 Pullman WA  99164-7012"

I attribute my success to several factors: Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me I only eat fruit vegetables and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat. Very little sugar or salt. Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.) My clean your plate conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time and gives satiety a chance to catch up so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else. I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly and eating won't be practical then). I bike to work 22 miles a day year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores movies and everywhere else as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family) and increase my metabolism.  (Even so my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F) and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.) There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health. Obviously I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed. > I think all of us cycle.

All I can say is that I will not consume it. Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde it is actually relatively non-toxic. -- Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {imaharvardrayssdlinusm2c}!spdcc!dyer"

Rutin is a bioflavonoid compounds found (among other places) in the rinds of citrus fruits.

Okay so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all there are degrees of certainty.  It might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain treatment. On the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing. SECONDLY it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal. I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation. Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us. To me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme There've got to be controlled studies position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure. Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or in the case of PTSD once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home. Now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. (Especially if as NLPers claim the success rate is extremely high.) Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term follow-up is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure incidentally was done with a slightly different NLP technique before I learned of the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.) The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance.) The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying We don't have any way of knowing that it's effective. These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say  Why should I prove your theory?  and  The burden of proof is on the one making the claim. One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much detail as I'm capable of.) Actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with favorable results) but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal. To me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it. This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science. Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you Russell. If so I apologize. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

"2","This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before. He took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges. In the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do) the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea and a few cloves. On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes. Later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are: 1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from? 2)  About 5 or 10 years ago I remember hearing that carmel color (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something.  If the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the U.S. yet it is still being used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what? 3)  About 5 or 10 years ago I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic Earl Grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so. WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now as it happens) I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips. My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct? I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals. And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains nitrosamines which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing don't know about the others. An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal when it was discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils. This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic. The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal- broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!"

All I can say is that I will not consume it. [...] In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet. [Reproduced without permission] The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England where a group of researchers found that aspartame marketed under the tradename Nutrasweet appears to stimulate appetite and presumably the eating of more calories in the long run than if a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group of 95 people to drink plain water aspartame-sweetened water and sugared water they said that overall they felt hungriest after drinking the artificially sweetened beverage. The study received widespread media attention and stirred a good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public. However its results were questionable at best since the researchers did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not necessarily go hand in hand. In the years that followed more than a dozen studies examining the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted. And after reviewing every one of them the director of the Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins University Barbara Rolls Ph.D. concluded that consuming aspartame- sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in the amount of food eaten afterward. One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981 the government has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety. Still years of careful scientific study conducted both before and after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with monitoring public health) the American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs and the Food and Drug Administration have given aspartame one of the most studied food additives a clean bill of health. Granted the FDA has set forth an acceptable daily intake of 50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed the limit however a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take in 2750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of aspartame-sweetened soda pop 14 cups of gelatin 22 cups of yogurt or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa... A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4000 milligrams of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content of selected foods omitted] Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12000 to 15000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child consumes it it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with PKU avoid the substance labels on cans of soda pop and other aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine. -Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)"

We will ;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic ;engineering we will be able to insert whatever genes we want. ;No breeding no hybrids etc.  The ethical question is should ;we? Two past problems with eugenics have been 1) reducing the gene pool and 2) defining the status of the eugenized. Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to crowd out garbage genes. This may in the future become possible. Even if it does awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We don't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism nuclear winter ice age meteor impact new microbiological threats famine global warming etc. etc. are all conceivable. Therefore having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival. Of course the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else's. But if we could make philosopher-kings with great bodies and long lives would we (or they) want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused but for a while it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before 1984. I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others and have survived by making better choices when their turns came. Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that too. The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few. We as eugenists may make it an we may not. If we don't I hope there are reservoirs of garbage people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded garbage genes which will pull us through. I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same. Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have and I believe all men may listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far or else haven't had enough power for long enough. In summary I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one. And the answer in some ways hard in some ways easy is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power it is the Spirit. Sorry for the long post. Got carried away. Bob (ruegg@med.unc.edu)"

It *does* >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and >which are not.) To start with no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other hand with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  You people call THIS science?   (My opinion for what it's worth is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.) Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science. My second point though is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific. Within mathematics I think there are several examples especially before the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later mathematicians did prove them of course.) I think that for a good scientist empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here but I think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process but I think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science.) When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation. In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: > Namely is there really justification for the belief that > science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches? Admittedly my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable amount of effort in a serious scholarly investigation such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer. The science I was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century. I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of reason and observation. One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies. Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"

"2","My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our first child (due June 15th).  We interviewed a young doctor last week and were very impressed with her.

I believe the pediatrician *I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from any other doctor I've seen over the years.

You'd have to purify the river water first.  I'm not sure how practical that is with the Mississippi.  You'd better check with health agencies along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river.  If it is just microorganisms those can be filtered or killed but you may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals. Better be same than sorry.

"2","A bit more than a year ago a hernia in my right groin was discovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The hernia was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a plug and patch. The doctor considered the procedure a success. A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair. Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any specific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time. My question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from something else? Steve Heffner"

"2","-*---- I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work.  Lee Lady writes: > I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some > of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely > thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as > scientific work. Unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as unscientific. In article <C5nAsF.MH7@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes: > Seriously I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not in one respect. > I still have a major problem though with your insistence that science > is mainly about avoiding mistakes. ... Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about.  Consider for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc.  In short knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are mainly about. The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition. > Okay so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all there are degrees > of certainty.

I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls. As to the first I do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth.  I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence. One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence was presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.) > The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to > make this simple test.

(Most of them are also just plain not interested because > the whole idea seems frivolous.

I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds. This is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out no one wants to become this generation's Rhine. > One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely > unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't > been described in a scientific journal. ... I think this is absurd. > Actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done > (with favorable results) but it's apparently not acceptable because > it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal. I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly eases one's defense.) Finally I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little about either and so have nothing to offer. Russell"

"2","As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD? I must assume that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was. She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way she believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict. (Eat all the chips chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right then the moral and ethical standards of the food chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ? This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference but some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions for the net are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?

No there is something called the Delany Amendment which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the 1950's before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude. This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the Act they are banned. This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned. This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves. If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someone would do it in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect. An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file'. This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural form so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption was made to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats."

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out msg is a naturally occurring substance in a lot if not most foods.  When food manufacturers add it to a preparation they do so because it's a known flavor enhancer. Your wife's theory that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite may well be true.

"2","Frequently of late I have been reacting to something added to restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel puffy like I have a cold and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy. The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants (usually chinese) the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food chain a japanese steak house (I had the steak) and another chinese fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice. I am under the impression that MSG enhances flavor by causing the taste buds to swell.  If this is correct I do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell. Also as the many of the occurances (including two of the above) involved beef and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG this is what I suspect as being the cause. I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals showed it as being harmless as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny. Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied they know of.

"2","We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on Nassau Street Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation a nonprofit foundation established to encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us. On Saturday April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton a local family will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis. Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx vocal cords and trachea.  Caused by a virus the tumors grow block the air passages and would lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths. Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her lifetime. Even though the disease is hardly a household word it has affected the lives of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a newsletter enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level and aid in the prevention cure and treatment. Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to those viruses causing warts they feel a cure would be within reach if money were available for research.  Because RRP is rare it not only gets scant attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP Foundation's mission is to change that. Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale please call Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the Foundation's booth during Communiversity April 24th 12 to 4 p.m. in downtown Princeton or sent directly to: The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation 50 Wesleyan Drive Hamilton Sq. NJ  08690. Thanks   mstern@lindsay.princeton.edu"

Unfortunately too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers. This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their story all over the world? As a parting note wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for Meniere's?

By far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned physical examination. If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down into your scrotum or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.... Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal. Whether you have a recurrent hernia or this is related to the previous operation I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best position to make that determination. Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are far too expensive and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger. ==================================== Howard Doyle doyle+@pitt.edu"

Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular lipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since it repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy breadtubes.

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression. Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger) or a religious person having recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities. The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind rather than being from an external source. Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety. In OCD the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual take an hour or more per day and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships. Treatments include psychotherapy behavioral methods and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.

As I understood it MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in tomatoes? Anyway lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural things; peanuts onions tomatoes milk etc.  Just because something is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks. As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor has an ulcer. People have long modified the taste of food by additives whether they be chiles black pepper salt cream sauces etc.  All of these things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them? How should food be tasted?  Isn't it better left to the diner? Julie DISCLAIMER:  All opinions here belong to my cat and no one else"
"2","The reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to: 1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with it or actually having this disorder ) and 2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated with seizures over the internet. Recently I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition. This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals procedures...etc. I don't want to go into a lot of detail but his condition was termed quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI EKG cat-scans are all normal but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests body structure tests and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is where we stand right now.... If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing from you. I am not trying to play doctor here but only trying to gather information about it. As I know now these particular types of disorders are still not really well understood by the medical community and so I'm going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle insight.

There >is a book The Yeast Connection which talks about this illness. > >There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists. There's a lot of evidence it just hasn't been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used. For example Dr. Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives before any other treatment a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results and for over 2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course this is only the beginning for his program. In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly written book):  e.g. extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc. which I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also *greatly* improved in other areas as well. Of course I have allergy symptoms etc.  I am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.  Also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course the $60000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc.) can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful however) so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons. BTW some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time. In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection' I cannot guarantee their safety.

She saw a TV show a couple months back (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC etc.) where an expert on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound. Should my wife be concerned?  Should we take the pictures to a radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so where would we find such an expert in Chicago?)

"2","Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup several years ago and I have just got hold of a book How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation by Margaret D. Corbett ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method) published in 1953.  It talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works is it by actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball or by increasing the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the too-long eyeball? Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process i.e. shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of eyeball but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's idea right?) Thanks for any information."

"2","I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway. About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue. While attending one of her therapy sessions while her arm was being manipulated some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm ( palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term. My questions are: Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what if anything was done to reduce the levels of pain? Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced? Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored? Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated. Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group. If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated. -- Gregory W.

Most early treatment of non-life threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess by a trained person but it's still no more than a guess. It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don't respond. There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn't have all the answers. This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a miracle cure maybe it's valid. How do you know? You might argue with the reasoning the conclusions. But your disparaging attack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for you r beliefs instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack. -Jackie-"

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some >claim their heart skipped beats once in a while. Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium but like everything else one can get too much of a good thing. >Some reacted with headache Again this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her necessarily. >some stomach ache. Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long) and lacks an enzyme to break it down gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected. > Some had watery eyes or running nose These are respiratory reactions and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive synergystic subtractive etc etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place the vertebrate body. > some >had itchy skin or rashes. People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that pisses off their body. Pollen for example of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people because when inhaled it sets of the immune system and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile linden etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. >More serious accusations include respiration >difficulty See above. And don't think that heart rate changes and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly. and brain damage. The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol as well as somatostatin and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be uh a wee bit unethical. >Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one >suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food poisoning. Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating  say undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic) plus too much alcohol and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home plus let's say having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things. But it might be the MSG. >if you heard things about MSG you may think it must be it. If noone else got sick its likely not food poisoning.

"2","I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home medical tests currently legally available. I believe this trend of allowing tests at home where feasible decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or more and allows the patient some time and privacy to consider the best action from the results of such tests. In fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer heart disease should be offered free to the American public. This could actually help to reduce national medical costs since many would have an earlier opportunity to know about and work toward recuperation or cure.

It is best to do nothing besides taking some pain medication initially. Some patients don't like this and expect or demand to have something done. In these cases some physicians will tape the patient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest) or prescribe an elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath but the patient doesn't feel cheated because soemthing is being done about the problem.

"2","I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold turned pale and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that heavy I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few minutes trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set and experienced continued arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of the day. My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -- my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold. Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain.  I'm 34 vegetarian and pretty fit from my daily exercise regimen.  So that can't be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar cause these symptoms (I hope)? Has this happened to anyone else?

"2","Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor? Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife. I took him to a local Urgent and General Care clinic at 5:50 pm.  The clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed here.  During the next few minutes in response to my questions with several trips to the back room the receptionist told me: - the doctor was doing paperwork in the back - the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going to the emergency room; - the doctor would not even speak to me; - she would not tell me the doctor's name or her own name; - when asked who is in charge of the clinic she said I don't know. I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room but I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a letter.

"2","someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture needles..... Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS from acupuncture needles. Generally even if accidently inoculated the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion. Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise disposable needlesused here. These needles tend to be of a lower quality however being poorly manufactured and too sharp in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles. If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments. The risk here for hepatitis HIV etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk. Better quality needles tend to slide past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them. Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue the diameter of the needle bore will be injected into the body as it would  be in a typical shot. when the skin is puntured. On the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted the skin tends to squeeze the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site. While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion I would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

This disease is universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992 the tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease. He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive. After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in September all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of shrinkage or necrosis. The patient's oncologist although telling him he would probably not live past December 1992 was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's treatment she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these treatments saying if it ain't broke don't fix it. Dr. Burzynski is an M.D. Ph.D. with a research background who found a protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients synthesized it and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

"2","Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain chemical reactions (2) promote communication of states with in a cell (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized example) and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location and time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not. Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred years old but not a popular activity.  Perhaps except in the case of a few tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes it is hard to reduce the investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding the healing of broken bones but not understood why. Bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as when Volta invented the battery.

Without knowing more it is not possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general there are no dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate to obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on recurrence of Crohn's.

"2","I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well. Let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way they must be a quack. I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically this is about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession. In animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth stomach small and large intestine) sinuses vagina and on the skin.  These are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what vitamin A does in the body he would not(or at least should not) be calling Elaine's doctor a quack. Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an E. Coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed. Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida unlike bacteria is very limited in it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses GI tract or vagina.  In diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it. If it's internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript. Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the GI tract(mouth stomach and intestines) and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier.  If they do an inflammatory response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom. While diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the  most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun) then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says. But even in patients being given the anti-fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus GI tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed(lack of a good bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina L. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics). In the GI system the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear. If the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the bloom manages to move further up the GI tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first place.  After extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor and so on.  Richard Kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant basis I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better Steve Dyer calls him a quack. Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments sex returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome. The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women. If taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A vitamin C and some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy). Some of the above material was obtained from Natural Healing by Mark Bricklin Published by Rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the GI system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose it's not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut. If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.

"2","I had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high school.  Before that I used to get bloody noses nighttime asthma attacks and eyes so itchy I couldn't get to sleep.  After about 6 months on the shots most of those symptoms were gone and they haven't come back.  I stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college. My allergies got a little worse after that but are still nowhere near as bad as they used to be.  So yes the shots do work."

If you can get your friend's physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's plan doesn't it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet. Marty B."

They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist.  :^) Actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population NT's comprise only about 12% of the population but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?) One driving characteristic of an NT especially an NTJ is their obvious choleric behavior (driver type A etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control to lead and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted they are best described as Field Marshalls.  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge to raise the level of competency etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However when the NT person has self-image challenges the dark-side of this personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all. A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling) and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most to know it all). Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^) Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom. >Let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have >no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that >balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...  Could it just be >professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did. You've helped me already by your post.  Of course I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis' but being the phlegmatic I am maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent. >...Humans have all >kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth stomach small >and large intestine) sinuses vagina and on the skin.

A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this >happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. In my well-described situation (in prior posts) I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans mucus color (won't get into the details) and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done however because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below). The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection. >Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals >and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what >vitamin A does in the body he would not(or at least should not) be calling >Elaine's doctor a quack. I was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor after my blood tests put me on 75000 IU of vitamin A for one week only then dropped it down to 25000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement) and made sure that I maintain a 50000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^) Hopefully Elaine's doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking for example niacin in fairly large dosages 1 gram/day which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage. >survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides >the other organisms living with it in the sinuses GI tract or vagina.  In Though I do now believe based on my successful therapy with Sporanox that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal). BTW my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry can't remember which one) and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion. >some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus >membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to >the candida or not isn't certain. My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans and I showed a strong positive. Another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a M.D. degree or a Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis. BTW and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker in his book Sinus Survival has routinely given before anything else Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it doesn't cure it by any means implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help. This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again I admit lots of 'ifs' and 'implies' which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation a strawman if you will. >If it's internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty >nondescript. This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body. It's a real Catch-22. Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done and that will take big $ to do it right.  However in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results. It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will not and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister... >Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in >the sinuses the GI tract(mouth stomach and intestines) and in the >vaginal tract which compete with it for food.

Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia? >While diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the  most common cause of >this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which >knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main >competition for candida as far as food is concerned.

Again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (roots) into deep tissue similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks) that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract candidiasis.  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away. The $60000 question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g. allergy) without becoming systemic in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal. >In the GI system the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good >reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very >favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and >humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.

When I finally find a >doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better Steve Dyer calls him a quack. As I've said in private e-mail there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example I went to three ENT's who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin C lentinen echinacea etc.) my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to live with it.  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total cure.  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.) >...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic >GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his >patients is a non-existent syndrome. Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said you'll just have to live with it.  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient. Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth (e.g. they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified) should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment and as a result I have found significant relief. Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having his license pulled can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: well I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country and since they clearly don't work for you I now have the authority to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.  Anyway if my ENT had suggested this to me I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of which seem to work (like my case) and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

I tend to disagree- I think anecdotal evidence provided there is a lot of it and it is fairly consistent will is very important.  First it points to the necessity of doing a study and second it at least says that the effects are all psychological (or possibly allergy in this case).  As I've pointed out before pyschological effects are no less real than other effects.  One person's make-believe can easily be another person's reality.  Using psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example the hallucinations one person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on an acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going to happen.  Anyhow that was a pretty lame example but hopefully I made my point- it's all a matter of perception and as long as someone ingesting MSG perceives it as causing bad effects then s/he can definitely experience those affects.  On the other hand it could just be an allergy to the food it's in   or something.  Still anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff that leads to the study being done. -Dan"

I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle and barely feel it.  I'm not fat just have a little gut.  My legs however are muscular and I have to pinch to get anything and then I inject at about a 45 degree angleand it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot to prevent irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep wait for it to dry somewhat or you may get the alcohol in the puncture and of course that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2  apart.) This is from experience so I hope it'll help you.

Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing but if a food causes problems avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.

"2","I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys). Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams per day). 1. Review Article Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev. 5(3):110-129(1985). But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both glycine and vitamin C one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin B6. 2. Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988) 200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program. 3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria Clin. Sci. 38 :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels. For gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C the effect is quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism. The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 6 grams per day not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day) more of the extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 85:190-92(1954) intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose 4 gram dose 8 gram dose and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average before supplementation. B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient in B6 some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309 -151980).  If 400mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion. Here are the high oxalate foods: 1. Beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea. Contain at least 25mg/100grams 2. Beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe. Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams. If the threshold is 130mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6 you shouldn't have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months). The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 requirement) as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that either block B6 absorption are metabolic antagonists of B6 or promote B6 excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given B6 supplements. One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium-oxalate. 4. The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculiInvest. Urol 10:147(1972) 5. Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium interactionJ. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990). 6.Review Article Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987). There are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them I thought I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.

"2","One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids (FAs). I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in Inflammatory Bowel Disease MacDermott Stenson. 1992.] But if I recall correctly there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies) but if I recall correctly there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed layperson's perspective this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA then the ratio of bad prostanoid products to good prostanoid products could still be fairly bad. Isn't this ratio the issue? What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories). -Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>"

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them did which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine Jan. 1988 I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs. Astonishly there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands recurrent fevers and nightsweats etc. that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows but theories include: psychological stress some sort of virus (a retrovirus say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses) environmental toxins bacteria (and yes candida) genes (and/)or some combo of these. There's no outright cure at the moment but different docs try different things some of which seem to help. Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days. Post your Q to alt.med.cfs and you will be flooded w/facts. Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable) diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good doc."

There is a role for short chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches that are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter).  There may be a role for treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids and I am looking forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are doing. You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other fatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that or even write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.  By the way the abbreviation EPA is not in general use so I do not know what fatty acid you are speaking about. And to Brian an U of C ---  There is a physician named Stephen Hanauer there who is a recognized expert in the treatment of IBD.  You might give him a call.

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of the squeaky-clean traditional crew-cut talk to the AMA before starting any treatment kind) who recommend treatments that though accepted may not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is significantly inflated by these quacks of a different color.  In fact I'd say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and- destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non- traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help. *************************************************** Now to make a general comment on many recent posts: *************************************************** Lately I've seen the word quack bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical subject in a civilized manner all he/she has to do is say quack-quack and somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach you in medical school - how to throw your authority around? Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  quack is a nebulous word lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand. The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming from any medical doctor (or wanna-be) where competency is expected is real scary. But what do I know I've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this newsgroup as being 'anal retentive' and 'psychotic'.  I look forward to more net.diagnoses.  Hey they're free.

"2","I am writing this to find out the following: 1.)	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis. 2.)	The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery. 3.)	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer. My boyfriend age 34 and otherwise in good health was diagnosed with reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta Tagamet) as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed. These treatments were not effective and because the damage was worsening he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen wrap and a Hill Repair.  He opted for the Hill Repair. He recovered very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva). The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition which he called Barrett's Syndrome. If he can't avoid having reflux will he necessarily get cancer? Basically if anyone has any information on what he should do now I'd appreciate it.

The only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because it's DEAD! Also who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be completely digested in your stomach which is about pH 2. Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy balanced diet and relax. My advice is if you don't know what you are talking about it is better to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your ignorance.

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat it's hard to digest anyway. For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How tight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle. Be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive tract. Try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive. Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months. When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous. Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible. Nausea etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My first pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble. Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby.

There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly. There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones. There are people ahead of their time with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals. There are ill-reasoned absurd theorists. Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who. Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in Babylon. Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses aren't or can't be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue against the theory as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. Sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the disease they haven't developed something recognizable yet or they have something that no one is going to recognize because it hasn't been described yet. Sometimes they get a cure sometimes the illness wears out sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment sometimes they find it's incurable. There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an illness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking. -Jackie-"

As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms and is expirienced its use and interpretation he should be just as capable of reading it as any radiologist.

"2","My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome. This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it. I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions). I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. . I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia. I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology. Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much improvement in her condition over the past several months. -Jackie-"

Gee I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself my friends and my family but in the practice of medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than Aunt Susie's brother-in-law .... Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.

"2","Putting aside our substantial differences I'd like to ask the knowledgeable ones to give feedback on this.  Let me explain. One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old). Otherwise she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scans. She then had MRI scans done where small cancerous areas were discovered in her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot is in the lungs and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believe the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked until four years ago). Anyway I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is how it is different from other cancers how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right below the skull and can be easily removed) and statistically what are the chances for full remission/recovery?

Well I had had similar reactions many times.

And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge) - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg - and he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple explanation - I won't eat this stuff I WON'T cook with this stuff so I can either throw it out or give it away.) > From: pattee@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (Donna Pattee) > My guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained MSG Probably Lawry's seasoning salt.

"2","Last year I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an inguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would have caused it.  That is I hadn't been lifting more than other people do and in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became more painful and I had the repair operation. This year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to be another inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday for another fun 8-) operation. I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38 years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling apart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to suspect a congenital weakness but if so why did it suddenly appear when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger? Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia other than not lifting anything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack full of groceries and you may have noticed that your typical grocery sack is fairly small these days.

"2","The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries. I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did. ____________________________________________________________________________ [Reprinted w/o permission] There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services On a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctors' earnings is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10. It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called Families USA. The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe that doctors make too much money. The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for physicians.  Those polled said oh about $80000 a year would be OK. How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid. Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering. You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns $100000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority of Americans don't make those bucks  they assume that those  who do are stealing it from them. Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down  but don't  kid  yourself. Karl Marx lives. It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions  such as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to become a physician? If those polled said no  they didn't know then they should have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers  they should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a doctor? Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  How much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking courses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work and maintain a 3.5 average or better  and (c) spend four more  years of  grinding study in medical school  with the third and  fourth years in clinical training  working 80 to 100 hours a week  and (d) spend another year as a low-pay  hard-work intern  and  (e) put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100000  in debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 hours  a week  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or more until they retire or fall over? As  you have probably guessed by now  I  have  considerably more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and Clinton  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have called together to remake America's health care. Based  on what doctors contribute to society  they are  far more useful than the power-happy  ego-tripping program-spewing social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality. But propaganda works.   And  as the stupid poll  indicates many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the major cause of high medical costs. Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be. Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for our longevity--lawyers  Congress or the guy flipping burgers in a McDonald's? And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become a  nation  of  self-indulgent   lard-butted   TV-gaping   couch cabbages. Ah  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain they might have been more honest if they had said: Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest problems we have.   That problem is you my fellow American. Yes you  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure. You  and  your habits  not the  doctors  are  the  single biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything  it  is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do. In fact  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at your blubbery bods all day. So as your president  I call upon you to stop whining  and start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries.  Do as I say not as I do. But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid there is another solution: Don't use them. That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those spine poppers  needle twirlers or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit. Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror  make a slit here a slit there and pop in a couple of valves. You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)? Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it. And if it survives  you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots. By  the  way  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much pollsters should earn?

Anesthetic agents >can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of >the body as easily. The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital but I can answer a few general points. Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even young people find the change unsettling. Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say - anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the change of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures aiming to have the patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these patients early. Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us) generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to the individual patient. Even so there is some evidence that full mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult tasks not the gross change that the original poster noted. Haloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life of the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow release formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing more it is hard to comment. Don Mackie - his opinions esiology will disavow..."
"2","I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen drugs were definitely involved. My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital. He was fifty-three at the time and he was on 21 separate medications. The family protested but the doctors were adamant telling us that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that if he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well! With the help of an MD friend of the family we had all his medication discontinued. He had a seizure that night and was put back on one drug. Two days later he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions. I don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is an aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believe that because they have close control of you it's quite all right to take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reduces the chance that the patient will make a mistake but health care providers can make mistakes too and mistakes can be deadly under those circumstances. I grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless I suggest you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss it with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL at all. HALDOL may have been used validly or it may have been prescribed because OTHER medication confused her and because the hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly.

Unfortunately doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of the drugs a patient is receiving.  If one drug they are taking causes the patient's blood pressure to go up many times an antihypertensive is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug. This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs at home!!!! >....procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss >it with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL >at all.

In addition she proably should be examined by another doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking. I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during a lecture but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  If her current physician is unwilling to do this find one who will.  Either check the phone book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society. By finding a geriatric specialist he (she) will more likely be in tune with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help."

There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to spot reduce body fat other than surgically through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like fat so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the fat is changing into muscle but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate and one does not ever change into the other. ------------------------ Ruth Ginzberg <rginzberg@eagle.wesleyan.edu> Philosophy Department;Wesleyan University;USA"

"2","This is to followup my previous reply on this topic which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots. 1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder which though sometimes true is misleading.  It is not often found effective particularly by itself. Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute it to more to biological causes than psychological in places where this distinction becomes important. 2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible diagnostic marker.  However this might look like something people associate with psychotic conditions uncontrollable or unpredictable behaviors which is NOT the case with OCD. One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual can and does suppress some of their 'impulses' although they are an unending source of anxiety. The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable closer to a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.

Lucky how?

I do not believe that this is >yet a standard part of medical practice. Nor is it mine.  What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections. Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and biochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However it is NOT part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials. One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate the patients flora.  Don't try this at home. >not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.

The three active-treatment regimens and the all-placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than 0.001) but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ] CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted. Does this trial address every issue raised here no.

Marty you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with systemic symptoms.  There is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc).  We can't seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion. I'm lost!"
"2","This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer here.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human nutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community. I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting your flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified. From A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition: > 	In a psychological anthropology course I am taking we got > sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors shared > by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels sugar > intake and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms. > 	Is there any data on this or is it just so much hooey? > > Many thanks > > Michael I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms most physicians don't recognize it as a specific disease entity.  Here is everything that you would ever want to know about PMS. Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups: PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression) anxiety			depression irritability		forgetfulness insomnia		confusion depression		lethargy PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration) craving for sweets	weight gain increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities 2. palpitations 3. fatigue or fainting PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle. PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia. A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid. PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase). Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972). PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction B6 magnesium and vitamin E for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form: A. Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for a nutritional approach. 1986 A Year in Nutritional Medicine. J. Bland Ed. Keats Publishing 1986. B. Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension syndromes J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983). C. Premenstrual tension Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980) Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done). Here are a few of these studies: CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study Effect of a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy Lancet 2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training.  After 6 months there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling tenderness and nodularity. VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study The use of Vitamin A in premenstrual tension Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960). 218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200000 to 300000IU vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool size(500000IU to 1000000IU) and then see if this normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms. 10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS symptoms. Experimental Controlled Study Premenstrual tension treated with vitamin A J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts received 200000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms. After 2-6 months all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the vitamin A supplementation was stopped. Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver. These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins given for PMS(vitamin A B6 and vitamin E) vitamin A has shown the best single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin A toxicity. VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover trialJ.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo. After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of PMS(depression irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation. Experimental Double-blind Study The efects of vitamin B6 supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms Obstet. Gynecol 70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as behavior changes(poor mental performance decreased social interaction) Anxiety depression and water retention were not improved by B6 supplementation. Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man. Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Clin. Psychiatry News December 1987 as stating that B6 should be considered the first-line drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the patient does not respond then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day. VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study Efficacy of alpha- tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome J. Reprod. Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo group.  For depression the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group. Experimental Double-blind Study The effect of alpha-tocopherol on premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly received vitamin E at 75IU 150IU or 300IU daily or placebo.  After 2 months of supplementation 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H (other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve PMT-H symptoms). MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study Magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium Headache 31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued until menstruation. After 2 months the Pain Total Index was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer from PMS.  After treatment magnesium levels in these cells was raised into the normal range. Experimental Double-blind Study Oral Magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles both groups received magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition the total score on the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during PMS. There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. to be anecdotal in nature I have not bothered to cite them.  There are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri pellagra scruvy etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses. Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS. Experimental Study Effect of a nutritional programme on premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis Complement. Med. Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C vitamin E magnesium zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to take the supplements and switch to a low fat complex carbohydrate diet.  On a retrospective analysis 96.5% of the 200pts reported an improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that they no longer suffered from PMS. Experimental Double-blind Study Role of Nutrition in managing premenstrual tension syndromes J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987). A low fat high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program the vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel phase of their cycle. Experimental Double-blind Study Clinical and biochemical effects of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome J. Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this second group of patients no significant effect of supplementation on PMS symptoms was observed.

"2","Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine or the two in combination can reduce the body's ability to make use of available water?  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike recently becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters). I drank close to twice as much as anyone else and no one else was dehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issue since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general stamina so far as I could tell. It may be that I just plain need more water than most people.  But I am wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things. I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma (24 mg. ephedrine 100 mg. theophylline).  I gather that both those drugs are diuretics.  So now I'm wondering: does that mean they can reduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  Would it be a particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather exercise?  (I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot but that wasn't the case yesterday.)"

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies the best way to remove calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C the extra vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium from the plaques). The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium. 1. Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 2. The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular disease Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be overemphasized.  This is a review article. 3.

Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol added to their normal food.

Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon I think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections I'm really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out. The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials? The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very important one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out-of-hand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause pregnancy even in the presence of a hymen. I doubt that sperm could make it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum but it might be possible. So it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant. Also some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse without rupturing. The problem when investigating these phenomenae is of course getting an honest account of what exactly happened. -philippe"

We can't seem to >focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion. > >                           I'm lost! Point 1: I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully cognizant of since I too speak jargonese when with my peers).  For the situation in sci.med many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large causing significant miscommunication.  One example word and very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemic. It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fan the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really beat up by non-doctors for their views on medicine which they otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional difficult patient. Point 2: I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials (usually double-blind) or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors to do any differently would in this belief system be unethical practice.  And it follows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value either from a treatment point-of-view. And by and large as a scientist myself I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However as also being a human being (last I checked) and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment where standard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all the underlying intent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so the patient should come first when considering treatment. What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints.  In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them. This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license or worse to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion. Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am open to alternative therapies as well as why I have real difficulty (read apparent hostility) with the coldness of the 99.9% pure scientific approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with and by the scientific aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine imho.

Make a decision about whether you *really* want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant other. If you still want to be a medical doctor determine how you can improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also don't be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no sorry'.  I have turned down writing recommendations for some students because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments and some because I honestly could not recommend them at that point. Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof-reading and get their criticism both about what you are saying as well as how you say it. Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor in some area don't be afraid to spend some time in further coursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help here.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut courses it usually shows. Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus; substantial leadership roles in an organization help also. Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to spot and weed out. Overall a clear conception of where you wish to head and why you want to get there combined with an honest self-appraisal of skills and aptitude will be the best path to take in applying to any program medical or what-have-you.

"2","First off if I'm not mistaken only hibernating animals have brown fat not humans. Secondly your description sounds just like 24-dinitrophenol.  This is an uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman's terms it short-circuits the mitochondria causing food energy to be turned into heat. 24-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled amounts it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous. It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form rather than play around with 24-DNP. But if you insist I suggest you look up the literature in your own university library.  You can obtain 24-DNP by taking a first year organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's a commonly-used reagent)."

Does anybody know about it? Is it a problem to >have a cat in the same apartment? The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis.  It is a protozoan that lives and multiplies within cells.  In cats the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa can cross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic after the baby is born or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindness and mental retardation. Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however pregnant women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.  In addition whoever does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling anything else especially food.

I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision of newborn males on the population. Since your friend is not a man she can't imagine what it's like to have a penis much less a foreskin. I guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every male then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in appearance... The penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked...she must be going to school on a South Pacific island. Tell her to check the Journal or Urology for circumcision articles. I remember at least 1 on an old Jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....I mean if the cancer risk was that great the Europe who have been circumcising like crazy too. Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like mastubation.

I saw this a few years ago on Tomorrow's World (low-brow BBC technology news program).  The patient is lowered into a bath of de-ionized water and carefully positioned.

So is there a specific term for this feeling or am I a stragne person? I always believe I am unique. Thanks. Ping"

"2","I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better.  I applied to about 20 schools got two interviews got one offer and am waiting to hear from the other school. Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical school admissions process.  Numbers (GPA MCATs) are not everything but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other qualities.  Of course when this happens don't expect a refund on your $50 application fee. But the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response was it an acceptance denial or wait-list?  If I assume the worst that it was a denial then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How did your interviews go? As for how long you have to wait I've called a few schools who never contacted me for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if I haven't heard by now I can assume a denial.  Many rejection letters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are still interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become fixated on the mailbox go out have fun be very proud of yourself. What do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very mediocre GPA but high MCAT scores and I have been working as a software engineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this: VERY IMPORTANT -------------- GPA:	3.5 or better MCAT:   top 15% in all subject MEDIUM IMPORTANCE ----------------- Writing/Speaking ability Maturity Motivation for going into medicine Activities LESS IMPORTANT -------------- College or University Major Work experience Anything else you want them to know Anyway you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in many ways by the numbers but would like very much to understand each person as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But getting four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully you were able to impress them with your character. Good luck Jeff"

"2","I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295 down to around 214) as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then I got pneumonia and for some reason the Lopid stopped working very well; cholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilized over time but a new doctor had me quit wait a month then switch to Mevicore. On Mevicore my total cholesterol was down to 207  LDL was 108 and HDL was 35; but the trig's were still very high around 318 and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35)  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35). He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal (Just to be extra cautious though I'm sure it's not a problem.) and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what I want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of. Should the above liver and trig figures be feared?  What happens to folks with high trig levels?  Is my liver in danger with the above results?  Would I be better off on Lopid despite its inconvenient side effect or perhaps some other drug?  (Niacin affected my liver too)."

"2","Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems: First I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it the hernia is a relatively minor problem though I do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki ring on the other hand is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular if I'm not careful about eating slowly and thoroughly chewing food food occasionally gets stuck before reaching my stomach. This results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction. Fortunately the food has always managed to pass but this is annoying and causes frequent discomfort. My doctor wants to dilate the ring using the following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so was it painful successful etc. Also can anyone  comment on safety advisability and success rate of this procedure? Has it become a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding perforation reaction to anesthesia). The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number of extra heartbeats. In particular during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24 hrs along with a few PAC's. (Many days there are far more than this however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was normal. It certainly doesn't feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended runs of these beats one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish) thin and in good health (recent bloodtests were all normal) and do not smoke use drugs or caffeine etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as normal but don't want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day and with exercise (or something as simple as climbing some stairs). Also if I get up after sitting or lying down for a while I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the same time.

She was upset because her condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall and she has been ill all this time.  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents' HMO clinic she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney. When she asked why so many x-rays were being made she was told by a technician that they need to see the area from different views but she says that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn't help feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  She is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was happening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would she got worried. Also she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her and that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April... She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go to classes.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans to call back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to these questions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.

Advantages stated of circumcison included probably prevention of penile cancer (which interestingly occurs mostly in men whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor) simplicity of personal hygiene prevention of urinary tract infections and prevention of a unretractible foreskin  Disadvantages include infection from the procedure pain etc.  I apologize; I am trying to pull this off the top of my head.  I will post what I discovered in research; I did a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school. It really is a decision that is up to the parents.  Some parents use the reasoning that they will look like Daddy and like their friends as justification.  There is nothing wrong with this; just be sure it is what you want to do since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise a male although a major surgical procedure exists. >How about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water?

[...] B >  Marty B. Marty I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article on kidney stones as gospel. First of all I would want to know who sponsored that study. I have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from local newspapers magazines to TV-guide with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the Dairy Industries. There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing one's calcium intake. Secondly were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study didn't say that it only claimed that most kidney stones are large- ly calcium. Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time. Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are in my opinion still the most reliable indicators for the cause treatment and prevention of kidney stones. I for one will continue to recommend the most logical changes in one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

Unless the patient has a very short life expectancy the possible complications from a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery. The risks of surgery anyway are minimal. Unless they are exceedingly large hernias can be fixed under local anesthesia. Don't forget that hernias are one the leading causes of small bowel obstruction.

Actually severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are possible and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2 mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways however to keep the ostia open (however in a few individuals their ostia are naturally very small) and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this. The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of sinus surgery though. About asthma that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker in his book Sinus Survival *speculates* (and says it's not proven) that many cases of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage (postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated - not clinical proof but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation. Before doing any sinus surgery first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis. Jon Noring -- Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

Then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack even though he like Linus Pauling is lucid and robust well into his nineties--but nevermind about that.  He shouldn't charge for his equipment and supplies since they're no doubt not approved by the FDA.  Of course with FDA approval an MD or pharmaceutical company can charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as thalidomide.  But nevermind about that either. Unfortunately you dared to step into the sacred turf of Net.Medical. Discussion without a credential and without understanding that the righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced before dismissing you as a fool. But maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will send you some reasonable responses by e-mail. 1/2 ;^) 1/2 ;^( Oh yes I did have a point.

Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays that one should have over a given period of time because of all the environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans ionizing radiation is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care to comment?). Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones I don't think that there are many drugs that can help dissolve the kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery is being contemplated the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments. My condolences to your friend. Marty B."

My personal experience and I have the same history an build you do (related to the heart that is) is that my PVC's come and go with some months causing anxiety.

Assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss congestion or popping in the ears you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a bulb syringe but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or may even make things worse.

Please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have to be born in Canada or even live in Canada but they must have (or have had if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great Canadian scientists. About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the end of this posting. I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness and there may be a gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness I would be pleased to hear them. In any event please nominate people even if you are not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible. Please give me a name and email address phone number or mail address so that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above then give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist. After I have the list I will choose about six of the most interesting ones and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy Kidder's Soul of a New Machine or some other dramatic technique. The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with one paragraph biographies. If you have any other ideas about this project I am interested to hear them.

If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list please drop me a line. ================================================== That was two years ago. Since then I have received a grant from Science Culture Canada a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of the scientist Personal statement from the scientist Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist What I was doing when I was 12 So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist> Experiment you can do. There will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well. I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close to being it. Hope to find one soon. I would like to again ask for more nominations especially in the pure sciences of Physics Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed. I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists and to discuss what is great what is Canadian and what is scientist.

"2","Actually I am entering vet school next year but the question is relevant for med students too. Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically. Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy histology pathology pharmacology are for the most part mass memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most med students are. Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have never applied them to large amounts of data. Has anyone had luck with any particular books memory systems or cheap software? Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an older student who returned to school this year organization (another one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success. Please no griping about how all you have to do is learn the material conceptually.  I have no problem with that it is one of my strong points.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is rote memorization. Thanks for your help."

"2","Some of the MD's in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good (maybe in some cases with good reason).  In this post on depression I'm laying it all out.  I'll continue to post here because I think that I have some knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post you should know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future.

If anyone > can suggest a Philly area nutritionist or else some literature to read > I'd appreciate it. Lida I can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered from bouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy.  Lida I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped I tried to use supplements to bring her out of it.  I had cured her PMS using supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and she was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after by wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with supplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using B6 niacin folate and B12 to cure depression.  I'm not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was. Lida I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will fix the problem.  For chemotherapy I knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was pretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is a nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C) you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become very important. Lida without your permission I'm going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming from.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic Medical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because none was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by my students as sermons).  Here is what I cover: Indroduction and Carbohydrates 			Lipids Proteins I					Proteins II Energy Balance					Evaluation of Nutritional Status I A Clinical Perspective Evaluation of Nutritional Status II            Evaluation of Nutritional A Biochemical Perspective			Status III Homework Assignment Using the Nutritionist IV Diet and Fitness Analysis Software program Weight Control					Food Fads and Facts Age-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements	Food Additives Contaminants and Cancer Drug-Nutrient Interactions			Mineral and Water Balance Sodium Potassium and Chloride			Calcium Magnesium and Phosphorus Iron						Zinc and Copper Iodine and Fluoride				Other Trace Minerals Vitamin A					Vitamin E Vitamins D and K				Vitamin C Thiamin and Niacin				Riboflavin and Pyridoxine Pantothenic and Folic acids			Biotin and B12 Other Nutrient Factors				Enteral Nutrition Parenteral Nutrition Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this in the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have 217 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which I write myself) I've pulled figures tables and graphs from various copyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for educational purposes I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not send this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do). I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need to make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment Centers of America which is a private for-profit organization with hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup. For physicians reading this post I would suggest that you get the new Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown series book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more to residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the Preface of this new text: So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists hematologists or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice. Unfortunately about two thirds of the medical schools in the United States require no formal instruction in nutrition. But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related. ... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ system. Roland L. Weinsier MD DrPH Lida my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals (yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when women suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A nutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium reserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using certified standards and also those doing water lead analysis showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act). A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status. Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation anti-depressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depression.

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium- oxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine always has been and probably always will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom there is a chance that you will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of damage what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?). On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of calcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to measure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the serum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue reserve for minerals I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see how your technique compares with mine.

But before I do I want to get a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney stone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet as is heart disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out.  But once it is diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance. Same thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases don't use what I'm going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go. Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say don't worry my vitamin E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring. But let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as your little feet can carry you(better yet have a mammography done on a regular basis my wife kept putting her's off both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even scheduled one but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for the biggest Hospital in Tulsa). One more thing I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind man this is really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't be right on the money it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan the two M.D's who wrote the new Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want I'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want I really don't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think that I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind.  That's life. Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor (GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium nicinamide(niacin) glycine cysteine and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver brewers or nutritional yeast and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF a pretty good absorption is seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2% lowest for all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a fat burner.  Chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about 30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one there also seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to Type II diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response) intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 10(5):536(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often found in older people it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the RBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma. You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now. Here's Weinsier and Morgan advise on chromium.  They do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either and they also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum it will.  What then do they suggest? Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis put the patient on 200ug of CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day. What's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight (they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then exercise that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have a poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status. When he or she says what in the world are you talking about just say please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance.  If you can't do that I'll find a doctor who can thank you very much. Marty B."

Elisabeth let's set the record straight for the nth time I have not read The Yeast Connection.  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing by this hated book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book by why hate me? Elisabeth I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology 20th Edition. A book that you should be familiar with and not hate. Candida species colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present. Indeed candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic mycosis.  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or sick neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis. Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute it. What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms without systemic infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation (GI tract mouth vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: However some factors such as the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic may predispose to both mucosal and systemic infections.  I was addressing mucosal infections (I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the cure.  I guess that your nutrition course does not too bad. >>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections as they are commonly >>called are not truely caused by yeasts.

(shudder) > Or maybe you did know and were oversimplifying? My my Elisabeth do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you noticed my faculty rank I'm a biochemist not a microbiologist. Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But as you point out it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth you are probably a microbiologist and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist it's a lot of Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus go ahead and crucify me. You know Elisabeth I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too. I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what I've said that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into The Yeast Connection book because I don't know what's in that book plain and simple. And to be honest with you I'm beginning to wish that it was never written.

My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims and 2) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the yeast connection. But I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In the meantime I'd still encourage people who have incurable chronic sinus problems (especially if they overused antibiotics) to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with liver panels before during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It is an empirical approach for sure but when all else fails and your ENT says sorry you'll just have to live with it it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence (Dr. Ivker) supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At this stage you have little to lose particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with relatively healthy (i.e. non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of course your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you.

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer?  I was just wondeing since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist. A bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given intravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high concentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it. As far as pain the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the IV line. What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother has had cancer since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system. I hope I have answered some of your questions.  Feel free to e-mail me if you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother's care.

"2","For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful when I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also pretty long  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can  because I feel so tired when I wake up  even more tired than I was when I went to bed  which is usually too tired to work. Anyway  I recently had a really bad flu  so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So I used that anyway  and the three nights I used it  I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is  I actually felt refreshed the next morning. So  I am now trying to look into  both in the literature and experimentally  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids  since I am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate  so I bought some generic tablets of that  and tried one last night and didn't notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about 1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also  library research seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic form of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try. For other medical information  I have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry eyes  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia  so I made some changes in my diet consistent with that  and it didn't help  so I went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse  also taking vitamin supplements) Anyway  I am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids  and if there are any dangers of such use (Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions).  I don't want to try BZs  because BZ addiction seems to be a serious threat  and from what I hear  BZ sleep quality is not good whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff  and that also seems to lower sleep quality  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some kind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also  I would be interested in any other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried many of the non-pharmacological solutions)"

"2","A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital because of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to do a lumbar puncture for which a CT scan is a prerequisite. I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT lab had been very unpleasant to her. To begin with they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may have a deadly disease and next thing you know you're being put into this big scary machine without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me and they responded with annoyance and anger.  Next they inserted or tried to insert an IV catheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare without any words of explanation. Is there anything I can do about these pigs ? I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day out.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative. But this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to help sick people and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior. Fortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of the people who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and that sort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shit. Also since I named the hospital involved I should also point out that neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion of any of the other personnel at NCMH.

Except for ones caused by infections the treatment is generally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the case with your wife. Thyroxin orally does shut down the thyroid through a feedback loop involving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary thinks that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to tell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills for 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels they were normal. I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear. The pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at beginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at least require closer monitoring of hormone levels. Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness coldness and weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart) changes in vision and coarser hair and skin among other things. I am not a doctor so I'm sure I mistated something but the important thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they aren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body.

I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical community. Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection. Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A). When vitamin A was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C (which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason). The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite). Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic beta-carotene is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta- carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present (60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human adult liver should have 500000IU to 1000000IU of retinol stored.  We are born with 10000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about 30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they were born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that of retinol in the liver) are important then this low vitamin A reserve is not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S. The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1000 RE or 5000IU of vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4000IU of vitamin A.  Diet surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A (either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to 7500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserves). We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a normal vitamin A reserve(500000IU to 1000000IU).  I preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients. But for vitamin A only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation of Diagnostic Test Wallach M.D. a Little Brown Series book).  This level of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach as you will see later in this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2000ug/dl you should have plenty of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache redness of the skin hair loss joint pain). I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for PMS studies). Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10000IU).  One other problem with beta-carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A. Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde (retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake of vitamin C you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once it's formed it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's. Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are helping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A they actually do themselves more harm than good. Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation. In the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the first line defense against infection.  For cancer retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps DNA alteration and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time promoters are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant process. This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene. Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already has on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa when I teach at the allopathic medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures. Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50000IU of retinol.  The serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below 10000 to 20000IU.  Asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels were measured 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 20ug/dl. As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels. What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts from their book: Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for reproduction embryonic development and bone growth.  Protein-calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than 7.5mg(about 37000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over 20mg(100000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostois (bony depositis) headaches anorexia edema and fatigue. They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25000IU in adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical lab can't run it I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25000IU per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol. Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A. Recall that the PMS papers were using 100000IU to 200000IU of vitamin A. I don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the serum retinol level then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25000IU for patients with a demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 18000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus. Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress I think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.

"2","I am quite near sighted. I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to weld this back in place as well. My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often - several each hour. The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment. I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments. The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most interest to me: If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action? If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect afterwards. Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative but 8mg seems to work well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine and so may produce a residual hangover or drugged feeling the next morning. -- Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {imaharvardrayssdlinusm2c}!spdcc!dyer"

This is ridiculous and your doctor sounds like a nut if what is reported here is what the doctor actually said.  If your wife's pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic she'll need insulin replacement.  That doesn't mean she's dependent on insulin anymore than she was beforehand--if her body doesn't make enough she'll have to get it elsewhere.  Oral thyroid replacement hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism and it's really the only effective therapy available anyway.  Plus it's cheap.  Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone but that's a _feature_ not a _bug_ and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of hypothyroidism because her problem that her gland isn't producing enough.  There isn't a clinical phenomenon of thyroid insufficiency caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of prolonged administration of corticosteroids so there should be no worry about inappropriately suppressing the thyroid gland. >The last couple of >monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given >some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the >'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language >but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are but the >brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)

I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely to make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an important contribution to good health.  It is important to exercise (11 12) and also avoid fat calories (9 10). Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle (1 2 3).  I will not bore you with the statistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway. Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role in sensitizing the body's tissues to the hormone insulin. Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus in turn makes it harder to lose weight (4). Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles (5 6).  This protein sparing effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue.  By sensitizing muscle to insulin chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they burn more fat and less muscle.  Preservation of lean body mass has an important long-term positive effect on metabolic rate helping dieters keep off the fat they've lost. Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin. Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories so it's not at all surprising that insulin stimulates metabolism (4 7 8).  Note that I did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism. In summary you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy: A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories. - Eating fat makes you fat. B. Increase dietary fiber - low in calories; high in nutrients. C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week - burn calories. D. Take chromium picolinate daily - lose fat; keep muscle References: 1.  Kaats GR Fisher JA Blum K.

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall correctly the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine which is a highly reactive intermediate which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic glutathione is used up this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die. As to taking 20-30 of these tablets that comes to 5-7.5 grams of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult this would probably cause nausea vomiting abdominal pain and loss of appetite. Bob Schmieg"

Burzynski's work is not too promising. None of his A-1 through A-5 antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against experimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against leukemia in mice with the result that doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985) Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1 and A-5 (something which he has not shown A-10 has only been extracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually distinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10 against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes: leukemia non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer colon cancer cancer of the central nervous system melanoma ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested. It is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's theory requires soluble agents) but this basically hydrolizes it to PAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying peptide something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1 mixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects of thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity A-10 does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy. Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory early research past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be untrue. sdb --- sdb@ssr.com"

Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it). You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the Classic Example but there are probably others. Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By looking at the patterns striations and occasional blobs in the irises you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body. The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are: 1: How does it work? 2: What evidence is there? The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to evaluate.  I don't know about iridology but I've read a book on reflexology which is a remarkably similar notion except that the organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures. (Always beware the words channel and energy in any spiel put out by an alternative practitioner.) The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive. The word licensed in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong plants to eat and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license extends to the iridology and I suspect that if you ask you will be told that it means (Licensed herbologist) and iridologist. BTW the usual term is herbalist.

Med. on the topic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a very refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving that manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in pointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better progress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their techingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or better than drug treatment(using physiological measurements and not just the woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA editors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove itself to the medical community. I'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support nutrition education and research.  I've pointed out in a grant proposal that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and manipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing only drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs during his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being worse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his students in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17. Still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he used diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic Profession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to speak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little understanding of how diet affects human health.  This has to change.

Cute anecdote but hardly indicative of the population.  From the responses I've received to that post (all from men by the way) I get the impression that unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the need or desire strikes then that person is very hung up on sex. With tv programs about boobs (Seinfeld) and masturbation (again Seinfeld) and with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage pregnancy rate and the high abortion rate here in the States I would not assume that we American's are frightened of sex.

It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling of comfort such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful. Another thing.  When you sleep you lie down facing up with your palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you relax and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So you feel a shiver below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat). Then this shiver increases and comes up to your head and the roam you hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This roam is different from the high pitch but follows the shiver of your body. Shiver is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake. What is this shiver and roam?

I tried Prozac a few months ago and had some insomnia from it but no anxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the Prozac had done any good but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a 20mg dose didn't work. Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin reuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some. Now I'm trying 100mg/day.

The only problem I'm having is some minor GI distress but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next. My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin drugs usually Prozac.  If that works great.  If it works but has too many side effects try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.

"2","I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke and that it also makes the heart pumb slower in order to make up for the greater volume. My Internist who diagnosed my AV block slow heart rate and PVC's told me something different. She says that heart rate is associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle not its size. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume but the effects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block she asserts is another electrical effect which is irreversable - even when exercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners. So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart patients. Isn't that strange though? Are there any not-so-beneficial aspects to athlete's heart? Is it all good?

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade infection incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and mortality(mumps measles. etc.). > -- How often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick? > How often do they get colds flus ear infections?

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care. > -- Does being sick build immunity (leading to less illness later) > does it make kids weaker (leading to more illness later) or does it > not have any long term effect? Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response( new antibody production).  In addition antibody levels tend to decline with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high. Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children. > -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long > term effects? Yes chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support). > -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than > normal and what does one do about it? Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the infection. > -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance? There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein vitamin C vitamin A iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A vitamin C iron and zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status dark adaptation for vitamin A status red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far. But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone( like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition. Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good for getting general dietary advice from however. > Any data information or advice relating to this would be much > appreciated.  Thanks a lot. > > Ashwin.

If the mucus in one's nose collects (filters) particles going into the airway if a child then picks and ingests this material might it have a vaccinatory effect since if the body ingests airborne diseases or other 'stuff' on the mucus the body might generate antibodies for this small invasion?

Sounds pretty familiar.  I posted similar cries about last September when Caroline just entered daycare.  She was two then and have been with continuous colds since until last March.  As spring approaches her colds slowed down.  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds. Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she had antibiotics.  (The other time was due to sinus infection and I wished that I did not give her that awful Septra.) >Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions? There are the 'net studies' -- that is if you read this newsgroup often there will be a round of questions like this every month.

Gee I bet 50/50 you'll hear cases in all these catagories. > Is there any data on home care vs. day care? I am pretty sure an insulated child at home sicks less.  But that child still will face the world one day. > >-- Does being sick build immunity (leading to less illness later) That's what I believe and comfort myself with.  Caroline will get more and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other kid's mouth nor let other kids do the same.  Cold virus mutate easily. However I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these diseases so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net). That's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her off antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would have antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she fought the illness off.  I do understand that you don't have much choice if the child is in pain and/or high fever. >does it make kids weaker (leading to more illness later) or does it >not have any long term effect? If the child doesn't rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime then the child should be stronger. > >-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long >term effects? > I'll leave this to expert. >-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than >normal and what does one do about it? > If your child just entered daycare I'm pretty sure the first 6 months will be the hardest.  (Then you get more used to it.  Boy do I hate to see me typing this sentence.  I recall when I read something like this last September I said to myself 'oh sure.'  But I do get used to it now.)  However I do hear people say that it does get better after a year or two.  I am looking forward to a healthier next winter.  As it gets warmer I hope you do get some break soon. >-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance? > Eat well sleep well.  Try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary. Good luck.

No they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently and I thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too. The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum. The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls so you have to point the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal then inserting the thing snugly then pushing a button.  Unfortunately there are many things that can go wrong. It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees. I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this and she said she didn't like them either for same reasons.  She did give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear and what correct insertion feels like but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly on one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to the company about inaccurate readings and that someone from the company had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior to reading my temperature and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office. I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button then remove the probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience you have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect that many people don't realize this and therefore get bad readings for yet another reason. In short it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks but I believe it doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature."

"2","I have osteoarthritis and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes (type II I guess--no insulin). I've been trying to read up on these two conditions and what really surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for arthritis (at least for -women- with arthritis) but of course the very conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the weight gain. For myself I'm almost afraid to lose weight because no matter how gentle and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories in about eight small meals) the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. Instead it drops off precipitously and then comes back on with much interest like bread on the waters. With this experience it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can suggest is to make it as gradual as possible. Meanwhile some experts recommend no sugar others no fat others just a balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which- parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition and which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty. Is it my imagination or are these very old conditions very poorly understood?
